<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p>The study of Arms and Armour is one of absorbing interest
to a large and ever increasing number of the community,
inasmuch as it appeals in a marked degree to the student
of history, the antiquarian, and to those who work in the
realms of art. To the first it appeals as a concrete reminder
of the struggles of nations for liberty, independence, power,
or conquest; to the second it breathes of the age in which
it saw the light with all the feeling and tone which characterised
it; to the third it is a source of delight by the
consummate beauty of its form or the exquisite details of
its adornment. Unfortunately there are few books extant
which serve as a guide to the student, although there are
many which deal with the subject. The great works of
Meyrick, with Skelton his illustrator, are standard only in
a sense that it is necessary to be thoroughly acquainted
with the subject in order to guard against the many errors
embodied in them. Grose is hopelessly antiquated, while
Fosbroke, Stothard, Strutt, Shaw, Planché, Cotman,
and others who flourished before or about the sixties, only
deal pictorially or casually with the subject. The Rev.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
Charles Boutell by his translation of Lacombe did much to
foster the study, but it was from a French point of view, and
his epitome of English armour and arms, though excellent
in its way, is only superficial, and a digest of his great
works on Monumental Brasses. In the latter he probably
did more to further the study than any preceding author;
he was the first to rationally systematise the arrangement
of armour in periods in consonance with the salient features
it possessed, thus breaking through the previous methods
of classifying it by reigns, which was obviously absurd,
or by centuries, which was equally ridiculous. I have
followed his method with but little variation in the pages
of this book, inasmuch as no better arrangement is extant.
It is a matter for great pride to myself that such standard
works should have emanated from a former Hon. Secretary
of the St. Albans and Herts Architectural and Archæological
Society, and if the present volume should in any
degree further the good work of my predecessor it will
have achieved the height of my ambition. Hewitt is delightful
reading, but his arrangement is unsystematic and
involved; to the advanced student, however, he is invaluable.
The later works of Demmin, Clephan, Gardner, &amp;c.,
are masterly monographs upon the subject, but hopelessly
out of place in the hands of a beginner.</p>

<p>It is with a view to rectifying this obvious requirement
that the following pages have been compiled, and it is confidently
anticipated that a careful reading and digest of each
separate period of armour, supplemented with the study of
local brasses, effigies, museums, private collections, &amp;c., will
enable the average student to attack the more advanced
works upon the subject with equal profit and pleasure. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
is perhaps necessary to caution the student of brasses against
many existing cases where the armour shown is not essentially
that of the period when the person died, inasmuch
as many warriors in their old age requested that the armour
delineated upon their monumental slabs should be that in
which they achieved renown in youth or manhood. In other
examples the brass was not executed until some time after
the person represented had deceased, and details had undergone
change in the interim; while cases are not unknown
where the brass of one person has been taken to record the
demise of another, perhaps many years later. A flagrant
example of this may be cited in the brass of Peter Rede, <i>d.</i>
1577, in St. Peter’s, Mancroft, Norwich, who is represented
in complete plate of the years 1460 or 1470, with visored
salade, &amp;c. Occasionally we find the artist exercising his
powers of recollection with startling results, as in the case
of the Wodehouse brass in Kimberley Church, Norfolk,
1465, but probably executed sixty years later. The knight
delineated has a skirt of mail of 1490 with three fluted tuilles,
very high pike-guards, a camail of 1405 or earlier, sabbatons
of 1500, and a breastplate with placcate of 1470. Fortunately
such vagaries are so apparent that the observer is placed
upon his guard at once.</p>

<p>The average Englishman is probably more unacquainted
with arms and armour than any other technical subject.
Beyond a general idea that the Crusaders fought in mail,
and the Wars of the Roses were waged by warriors clad in
plate, his knowledge does not extend, and he consequently
witnesses many startling incongruities upon the stage of a
theatre, or the arena of a pageant, with the most profound
indifference. He will perceive Richard III. in a camail and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
Ivanhoe in a salade with the utmost complacency. The pity
of it is that those who are responsible for the historical
inaccuracies should be so ignorant, for no effort ought to
be spared in endeavouring to educate the nation, and especially
the youth of it, in the fundamental principles of
rigid historical truthfulness. In our theatres recently we
have witnessed Bolingbroke in a fifteenth century tabard,
a waist-belt, and round-toed sabbatons, with the Duke of
Norfolk in an almost equally grotesque parody of the
Camail and Jupon Period; Pistol with a basket-hilted rapier;
Henry V. in a camail, late fifteenth century gauntlets, twentieth
century boots, and vambraces covering parts of his
coudières. Upon the arena knights of Richard II.’s period
have appeared in full plate armour of 1470; at Queen
Eleanor’s funeral without ailettes; while bear’s-paw sabbatons
have figured conspicuously in many scenes previous to
1480. These are elementary details which even a cursory
knowledge of military equipment could avoid, but in the
illustrations of historical scenes in books and magazines
equal ignorance prevails, and a knight in pure mail and a
surcoat, making love to a maiden in a reticulated head-dress
seated under a two-centred Tudor archway, is only an
example of the incongruities which almost every day insult
the intelligence and offend the eyesight of the educated
reader. Unfortunately many illustrators go to the works
of Sir Walter Scott for details of mediæval military equipment,
and are thereby led hopelessly astray.</p>

<p>It will be noticed in the following pages that continual
reference is made, respecting early armour and weapons,
to the MSS. which are preserved in our inimitable national
collection at the British Museum, and I cannot too earnestly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
advise the student to utilise to the utmost extent possible
the treasure-house of military detail preserved therein.
The feeling which prompted early illuminators to represent
Biblical and other personages in contemporary equipment,
whereby Goliath was shown habited in Norman hauberk
and helm, Moses appeared on horseback with couched
lance in the mixed mail and plate of the thirteenth century,
and Julius Cæsar crossed the Rubicon in a salade and
complete Yorkist plate, is simply invaluable to the student,
inasmuch as every detail, though at times almost microscopic,
is faithfully delineated, and every new fashion
recorded at once upon its adoption. I have drawn upon
many manuscripts for illustrations, but there are scores
still untouched which only need the student’s attention
to deliver up many valuable examples of details probably
quite unknown at the present time.</p>

<p>There are collateral subjects connected with the study
of Armour and Arms which the exigencies of space
have compelled me to wholly or partially omit, such as
heraldry, mantling and the changes it underwent, caparisoning
and barding, the later development of weapons
of precision, history and varieties of the sword, &amp;c., some
of which would require special monographs to deal with,
and do full justice to, the subject.</p>

<p>One of the main ideas has been the simplification of
those points upon which the majority of the books extant
are either silent or deal with in a casual and unsatisfying
manner. One period especially, which gave me infinite
trouble as a student, is that between 1320 and 1360, while
another feature, generally omitted or hurriedly glossed over,
is the equipment of the common soldier.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
In conclusion I must express my deep sense of obligation
to the authorities connected with the Tower of London, the
Wallace Collection, the British Museum Manuscript Department,
the South Kensington Museum, the Rotunda at
Woolwich, the Edinburgh Castle Museum, the United
Service Institution, the Armourers’ Hall, &amp;c., for the
kind facilities they have willingly and promptly afforded
for sketching, photographing, and examining the various
exhibits preserved in those institutions.</p>

<h3>WEAPONS OF PREHISTORIC MAN</h3>

<h4>THE STONE AGE</h4>

<p>The prehistoric man of the Stone Age had undoubtedly
one of the most difficult materials to deal with that can
possibly be conceived, inasmuch as it was intensely hard,
very brittle, and, so far as flint is concerned, occurred
naturally only in comparatively small masses. Yet with this
crude matter, and with implements of the same material,
he succeeded in producing implements for husbandry and
domestic use, weapons of war and for the chase, which
excite our warmest admiration, both for the beauty of their
proportions and the exquisite skill required in their manufacture.
To the worker in flint the number of objects
capable of being produced in that exceedingly refractory
medium was limited, but these as the age progressed were
eventually of a very high order of excellence, probably
deemed unattainable by the earlier man. We will take the
different weapons in the order of their importance, premising
that in this chapter we shall have no armour to deal
with, though doubtless the man of the very earliest age<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
had some protection in the way of skins, plaited osier, or
bark with which to ward off hostile blows, in addition
to the shield, which is common to
every race without exception when
in the savage state.</p>

<p><i>Celts.</i>&mdash;The word “celt,” said to
be derived from a doubtful Latin
word signifying a chisel, is the name
by which a particularly large and
widely distributed class of weapons
or implements is
known. The word
has no connection
with the Celtic
people, and should
be pronounced “selt”
and not “kelt,” as one frequently hears.
The form of the celt is well known,
inasmuch as many hundreds exist in our
museums and private collections. They
are found widely distributed in all parts
of Europe, and generally throughout the
known world, being regarded in many
places in mediæval and even in modern
times with superstitious reverence as
thunderbolts with inherent mystical
qualities.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 2.&mdash;Stone celt with

</div>

<p>The primitive celts occurring in England
are simply flints roughly chipped
into form with unsharpened edges, and are chiefly found
in those counties where flint abounds. They are not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
however, confined to them, but occur in other parts where
flint is not abundant, being fabricated in a different
material such as agate, quartz, granite, obsidian, clay-slate,
greenstone, serpentine, and other rocks. These
crude celts, being merely chipped out and very roughly
formed, are at times difficult of recognition; they belong to
the Palæolithic or earlier period of the Stone Age. The
second development of the celt appears in the grinding of
one edge so as to produce a cutting portion (Figs. <a href="#fig1">1</a>, <a href="#fig2">2</a>),
the ruder ones simply having a serrated edge produced
by being chipped. This grinding was doubtless executed
by means of sand and water, and in scores of examples a
remarkably even result has been obtained (<a href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>). The
third form in which the celt is polished all over is the
highest development and the most recent (<a href="#fig4">Fig. 4</a>), and is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
classed in the Neolithic period. Some of these have ornamentation
upon them in the form of ribs running longitudinally
upon the sides, and some are bored with a circular
or oblong hole. For use these celts were fixed transversely
at the end of a haft of wood either by binding or by the
wood being cleft for their insertion; in peace they performed
all the offices which are associated
with a hatchet, and in war those
of a battle-axe.</p>

<p class="clear"><i>Spear-heads.</i>&mdash;The greater part of
these belong to the later period, and are
remarkable for the care and attention
which has been bestowed upon their
construction. They invariably present a
lance-like outline of symmetrical proportions
with the edge in one plane,
and are chipped so as to be very thin
(<a href="#fig5">Fig. 5</a>); at times notches occur upon
either side to facilitate their fixing into
the end of the spear shaft and being
bound firmly in it. Others have been
found with the cutting edge carefully
ground and polished, but with the tang only chipped
and the edges serrated to afford a firm grip for the
sinews used to affix it to the shaft. They vary in length
from three to ten or more inches.</p>

<p><i>Arrow-heads and Javelin-heads.</i>&mdash;The earliest forms
of these are simply elongated splinters of flint or other
stone, and undoubtedly were simply tied upon or inserted
in the end of the arrow shaft by a ligament. They show
but little work, simply as much as was necessary to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
a satisfactory point, and to provide a tang for fixing.
These may be termed lozenge-shaped (<a href="#fig6">Fig. 6</a>), and side
by side with them are those of a leaf-shape&mdash;these
two being the designs presenting the
least amount of work and skill in fabrication.
Subsequently a barbed and tanged variety was
evolved, showing the maximum amount of
technical skill in the making, and having
the most deadly properties by reason of the
difficulty of extraction when once inserted
under the skin (Figs. <a href="#fig7">7</a>, <a href="#fig8">8</a>). They are as a
rule of symmetrical proportions, the barbs
carefully chipped to offer the least amount
of resistance to the penetrative force of the
arrow, and even at times a certain amount
of polishing and grinding was added to
insure keenness to the point and edge.</p>

<p>The British Museum is in possession of
a number of these arrow-heads, which
may be considered almost as works of
art, together with some of larger proportions
which undoubtedly
formed the heads of javelins
(<a href="#fig9">Fig. 9</a>). Being fabricated
of such imperishable
material they have naturally
been preserved in very
large numbers, and hardly
a museum exists without
at least a few specimens being contained in it. In the
mediæval period many quaint superstitions were associated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
with them, and their preservation as amulets, charms,
and general attributes of curative powers, &amp;c., has led
to the handing down to the present generation of scores
which would probably have been broken up in the ordinary
course of events.</p>

<p><i>Daggers.</i>&mdash;The dagger is one of the commonest forms
of weapon relating to the Stone Age, as might be supposed
from its simple form and easy construction when compared
with others. In its crudest and earliest condition it merely
consisted of a flint rudely chipped to a point at one end;
but subsequently it assumed a more definite form, and
almost equal attention was paid to the handle and to the
blade. The latter was invariably leaf-shaped, and broader
towards the point than at the butt, where it is usually
rounded or cut off square. The beautiful example,
<a href="#fig10">Fig. 10</a>, is of white flint and may be seen in the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
Museum, while <a href="#fig11">Fig. 11</a> from the same collection is of
black flint and about eight inches in length. As this is
thickened at the butt it may have been used without
any handle, but undoubtedly most of these blades were
so mounted, and in <a href="#fig12">Fig. 12</a> we have an example of the
notched variety, where two indentations are perceived on
either side for the passage of the tendons
fixing the blade to the handle. In a few
cases a shaped handle having a pommel
and a grip, and with the blade formed
out of the same piece of flint, has been
discovered; the weapons in these instances
have been ten or twelve inches in length,
and modelled precisely the same as the
bronze dagger which succeeded them.
The highest type of flint weapons of the
dagger class are those which have been
discovered in Egypt; they are provided
with long thin blades, beautifully ground
or chipped on one side to form an edge,
and elaborately serrated upon the thicker
side forming the back, with cross ripple
markings for ornamentation, the whole forming a specimen
of clever handicraft and skilful workmanship which can only
be adequately appreciated by actual inspection.</p>

<p>Among the weapons of the Stone Age may be mentioned
the sling-stones, which are found in considerable
numbers in countries where flints abound; they are of a
lens-like shape and from two to three inches in diameter,
being probably formed in this manner for insertion in a
cleft stick which was used for throwing them. Balls of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
stone are also occasionally found with grooves in them,
which suggest the presence at one time of string; these
may have been used as weapons for throwing with the
string attached, or wielded in the hand as a flail.</p>

<p><i>Battle-axes.</i>&mdash;Although the celt may be regarded as
fulfilling the functions of a battle-axe among its other
manifold duties, yet a true battle-axe was evolved by the
Stone man towards the latter part of his existence. It
was invariably perforated by a circular hole, effected
by grinding, and as a rule assumed approximately the
shape shown in <a href="#fig13">Fig. 13</a>. Examples of these battle-axes
have been found with cutting projections upon each side
of the shaft; this was probably the prototype of the
bipennis subsequently made in bronze and finally in iron.
An example is shown in <a href="#fig14">Fig. 14</a>.</p>

<h4>THE BRONZE AGE</h4>

<p>The term “Bronze Age,” so generally used for the period
immediately preceding the introduction of iron, conveys
to most readers very scanty ideas as to the duration of
time over which it extended. Indeed, to those thoroughly
conversant with the subject, the chronological arrangements
of the various periods of the age, and the grouping
together of these into one comprehensive whole, is
practically a case for individual calculation, and these tally
but seldom. However, it may be taken that, speaking
broadly, the bronze period commenced in Britain about
1500 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and at a much earlier age upon the Continent,
one authority placing it as early as 3000 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> Iron was
in general use about three or four centuries before Christ
on the Continent, and Cæsar makes no mention of bronze
in his description of the weapons and accoutrements of
the Britons.</p>

<p><i>Celts.</i>&mdash;Of all the varying forms of bronze implements
the celt is probably the most widely distributed and the
best known, and there is every reason to believe it was
the first of the articles to be manufactured. It is generally
admitted to be both an implement for everyday
use and also a weapon of war. Its general utility was
that of a chisel, a wedge, or a wood-splitting hatchet;
in war it was the prototype of the battle-axe. It is of
very wide distribution, being found all over the Continent
of Europe, and has many varieties. In order of development
the flat celt is undoubtedly the earliest, and was
derived from the celt of the Stone Age, the example<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
shown in <a href="#fig15">Fig. 15</a> differing but little from the flint prototype.
This pattern gradually developed until one similar
to <a href="#fig16">Fig. 16</a> was evolved. From this crude form the
flanged variety was produced, giving an
extra grip for the handle; then a transverse
ridge was added, thus forming two receptacles
to receive the split end of the handle
(<a href="#fig17">Fig. 17</a>). The latest development of the
celt is that in which a socket is made for
the insertion of the handle (<a href="#fig18">Fig. 18</a>).</p>

<p>The relative form of the handle with
the celt affixed has been much discussed,
but the consensus of opinion leads one to
believe that the handle was somewhat in
the shape of a hockey-stick, the bent part
being inserted in the socket of the celt.
Before the evolution of the socketed celt
the latter was inserted in a cleft stick and projected from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
one side at right angles, being firmly bound in that
position by cross-lacing. This projection doubtless suggested
the bent stick of a later period.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Daggers.</i>&mdash;Of contemporary date with the celt, and
perhaps of even more remote antiquity, is the bronze
dagger, which in its original simple form
may have been used as a knife for
domestic purposes and a dagger for war,
though subsequently the two became
quite distinct. The general
form of the blade may be
gleaned from Figs. <a href="#fig19">19</a> and
<a href="#fig20">20</a>, where the ribs towards
the point may be readily
seen. This ribbing and
grooving of the blade are a
distinctive feature, and are
sometimes beautifully developed
into a pattern more
or less intricate. The
handles were made of ivory,
bone, or wood, and are very
seldom found entire. The
method of adjusting the haft
will be gleaned from the position of the rivets; the handle
was evidently either split into two pieces and then placed
on either side, or a cut was made for the insertion of the
tang or lower part of the blade. In some cases the pommel
of bronze has been found accompanying the dagger, and
also traces of what may have been the sheath. That
variety of dagger having a tang to fit into the shaft seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
to be peculiar to our islands, as those found on the Continent
invariably possess a socket into which the handle
could be fitted. Some very small and thin daggers have
been found side by side with flint weapons, which appears
to point to a time when the metal was very scarce, in the
earliest part of the Bronze Age; subsequently the stouter
form of weapon shows analogies with continental forms,
and so points to intercommunication between the mainland
and this island at that early date.</p>

<p><i>Swords.</i>&mdash;The sword does not appear to have been
contemporaneous with the early thin dagger, but was no
doubt a subsequent evolution based upon the dagger.
Of all the forms which have been handed down to us
from the most remote antiquity, the bronze sword is the
most beautiful, and it is very questionable if any of the
hundreds of shapes of lethal weapons of that description
which have subsequently seen the light can vie with it
in symmetry of form and general gracefulness. Only one
other class of weapon of this period attempts to rival in
beauty the leaf-shaped sword, and that is the spear,
which is often of the most graceful lines. The beautiful
workmanship exhibited by these weapons raised doubt
at times as to their real origin, many asserting that
they were of Roman fabrication, but it has been
definitely settled that they antedated the Italian historical
period. Iron and steel were substituted for bronze at a
very early period in the Roman army, the shape, however,
being unaltered. The fact that the majority of
finds of bronze swords occurs in countries where the
Romans never penetrated militates against the supposition
of their Roman origin. The length of the blade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
averages about two feet, though some are as short as
one and a half feet, and some as long as two and a half.
The hilt plate alters much in
form, and there are many varieties:
the handle was of wood,
bone, or horn, split into two
plates and riveted on either side
(Figs. <a href="#fig21">21</a>, <a href="#fig22">22</a>). The blade was
apparently cast in a mould so
carefully made that there was no
necessity for file-work or hammering
afterwards, the edges being
formed by the uniform reduction
all round of the thickness of the
metal (<a href="#fig23">Fig. 23</a>). Blade and tang
were cast in one piece, although
one variety which appears to be
common to the British Isles has
a handle affixed to the blade by
rivets, after the manner of the
dagger (<a href="#fig24">Fig. 24</a>). The rivet heads
occasionally show signs of having
depressions in them, as though
they were splayed by a punch,
while some have been closed by
a hollow punch so as to leave a
small stud. Occasionally swords
are found having the hilt and
finished blade cast in one piece,
while others occur bearing signs of the hilt being cast
upon the blade. A few swords have been found with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
gold ornamentation upon the hilts, and many in which the
blade is decorated with a pattern produced in the casting.
Although of bronze, and therefore not subject
in any great degree to aerial oxidation, the
sword appears to have been universally protected
by enclosure in a scabbard. These in
some instances were of bronze, but more often
of leather or wood, with fittings of bronze, and
in all cases the scabbard was of
greater length than the blade it
contained. Some scabbards even
appear of fantastic forms, as
though the man of the Bronze
Age, like his successor of the
Iron Period, was not averse to
the occasional outshining of his
fellow-man.</p>

<p><i>The Spear.</i>&mdash;The spear is undoubtedly
of the most remote
antiquity, and dates far back into
the Stone Period; its inception
seems to be inherent in all
savage tribes, and is a natural
evolution of the idea of inflicting
injury upon a foe at a distance,
and again of preventing his approach
to do personal harm. The
primitive man probably pointed a
long stick by attrition on a rock,
and subsequently hardened it by fire: a splint of bone,
being harder than the wood, occurred next, and probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
the flint succeeded, to be followed in due time by the
bronze head. The difficulty of affixing the head, however,
seems to have hindered progress at first in this direction,
for the bronze dagger undoubtedly antedated
the spear-head, which continued to be of
flint for a long period after the dagger was
introduced. It is highly probable that the
first spear-head was not constructed until
the Bronze man discovered the secret of
making the socketed celt by means of a
core placed within the mould; with the
advent of this invention spear-heads became
possible. Of course it may be open to
question whether any of the blades with
tangs were really spear-heads and not
daggers, or incipient sword-blades. Some
spear-heads have been found which are undoubtedly
of the tanged description, but
they are not of British, and possibly not
even of European origin. The general form
of the head tends towards the leaf-shape,
though this is not so pronounced as it is
in the sword (<a href="#fig25">Fig. 25</a>). The advent of the
spear-head occurred when man had developed
considerable skill in the casting of
bronze and its manipulation under the
hammer, and the really extraordinary deftness
shown in making the core, so that the minimum
of metal was used with the maximum of effect and
strength, calls forth the warmest admiration. Some of
these cores are prolonged through the centre of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
blade, so that the metal is really attenuated, but at the
same time of uniform thickness, the inserted staff providing
the necessary rigidity. Respecting the
sizes of those found there can be no question
but that the larger heads (and some have been
found nearly a yard in length) were intended
for use only in the hand as spears, while some
of the smaller are the heads of javelins, or
possibly of arrows. The blades are at times
of remarkable beauty of design and of excellent
workmanship. The sage-leaf form is of very
common occurrence, the central core reaching
to the point, and ornamented with subordinate
ribs which also strengthen the blade. In these
forms a hole is punched in the socket for the
insertion of a rivet to fix it to the lance shaft.
Others show two small loops cast upon the
socket for a thong to pass through, which
was afterwards brought down to the shaft
and securely fastened (<a href="#fig26">Fig. 26</a>). This variety
shows no rivet-hole. Ornamentation is by no
means rare upon these spear-heads; it generally
takes the form of open work, such as circles
and ovals perforating the blade, and of filed
or cast patterns upon the sockets, some even
showing traces of gold inlaying. Barbed spear-heads are
extremely rare, and were probably only used in the chase.</p>

<p><i>Arrow-heads.</i>&mdash;Arrow-heads in bronze practically do
not exist in this country, although they occur on the Continent
and in Egypt, where they are generally of the types
shown in Figs. <a href="#fig27">27</a> and <a href="#fig28">28</a>. It is highly probable that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the flint arrow-head was in use through the whole, or nearly
the whole, of the Bronze Age, being retained because of its
efficiency and cheapness. Bronze must have been a comparatively
rare and dear alloy, and
the weapons exhibit as a rule the
minimum of metal in their construction
compatible with efficiency;
arrows from their very
nature are continually being lost,
and this fact alone would render
their use expensive.</p>

<p><i>Shields.</i>&mdash;Among primitive
races the shield was invariably
of wicker-work or of wood, and as the examples in bronze
which have been unearthed are of a high order of skill
in workmanship and design we may naturally infer that
they were of comparatively late introduction, and only
appeared when the expert artizan of the age was capable
of producing plates of considerable area and of uniform
thickness. In the British Museum are several very fine
examples of shields, one of which we illustrate to show the
general form and shape (<a href="#fig29">Fig. 29</a>). It was dug up not far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
from the river Isis, in the vicinity of the Dyke Hills, near
Dorchester in Oxfordshire. It is circular in form, about
13 inches in diameter, and ornamented with two concentric
rings of bosses which encircle an umbo. All these bosses
have been repousséd in the metal except four, which are
used in two instances as rivet heads to fix the handle in
position, and in two others to fasten buttons to the interior
of the outer rim. It is probable that a
guige was fastened to these buttons. So
thin is the metal that it can hardly have
served as a shield without some auxiliary
strengthening, and this was conjecturally
afforded by a lining of leather moulded
into the depressions of the shield when
wet. There is no reason for supposing
that the metal now seen was the size of
the original shield; in fact there is a
probability that it was larger, and that
the metal merely formed the centre. A
bronze buckler found near Aberystwith was formerly in
the Meyrick Collection and preserved at Goodrich Court,
whence it was transferred to the British Museum. It is
about 26 inches in diameter, with no less than twenty
concentric circles of knobs and ribs, with the usual buttons
for fixing the guige. The general type of shield is that
having a series of concentric rings raised in the metal with
studs between the ribs. The ornamentation is in all
cases raised by hand with hammer and punch, and doubtless
the metal was much thicker and the diameter much
less in the early stages of making.</p>

<p>A considerable number of bronze weapon-like forms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
have been from time to time discovered, the uses of which
are only conjectural. Thus long blades of a triangular
bayonet-like section occur, which may either have been a
sword or rather rapier for thrusting only, or have been
attached to a shaft and served as a spear. Others, again,
have a socketed head from the side of which projects a
cutting blade of various sizes and forms which might be
the halberd in an incipient stage. There also exist short,
thick, scythe-like blades of great strength, with strong
rivets for attachment to some shaft, which may have
been constructed to fit upon the wheels of chariots.
Knobs of bronze occur having a socketed centre and
projecting spikes upon the sides which undoubtedly when
fitted to suitable handles formed the maces of the Bronze
Age (<a href="#fig30">Fig. 30</a>), or possibly were portions of early “morning
stars” or military flails.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE ASSYRIANS</h3>

<p>The bas-reliefs of Assyria afford us ample materials for
becoming acquainted with the arms and armour of that
great and warlike empire, and our own national collection
probably contains the richest store of detail.</p>

<p><i>The Tunic.</i>&mdash;This appears to have been of thick
quilted linen or of leather, as sometimes long hair is
shown upon it. It reached to the knees and had half-sleeves:
at times a pectoral is shown of large proportions.
Another, and much more military style, consisted of rope
fastened side by side, and so bound round the body that
it had the appearance of a tight-fitting cuirass. This
would be much more efficacious against the sword and
the arrow than the tunic. It generally terminated at the
waist. In the earlier sculptures there are no indications
of the metal cuirass or of greaves, but the latter subsequently
came into vogue; they were of metal and reached
to the knees.</p>

<p>In the invasion of Greece by Xerxes the Assyrians
are described as having defensive tunics of flax, which
were stuck together surface to surface by a soft mucilage
to the number of over a dozen, and formed an excellent
defence against a sword-cut. All the varieties of armour
are faithfully shown upon the sculptures, some exhibiting
the scale-like nature of a few cuirasses, from which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
may infer that mascled armour was known to them as
to most Oriental nations.</p>

<p><i>The Helmet.</i>&mdash;This was generally the hemispherical
skull cap so much affected by Asiatic races then and now;
it was made either in iron or leather, furnished with a
chin-strap, and decorated at times with a horse-hair crest.
A design is sometimes seen which strongly approaches
the Phrygian in shape, having a portion of the crest
curving over towards the front, while another variety is
that of a truncated cone curved backwards. Defences
for the neck and sides of the neck are common.</p>

<p>At Marathon the helmets worn were “interlaced or
interwoven,” from which we may infer that chain mail
was not unknown to the Assyrians; it may, however,
refer to bands of metal plaited together.</p>

<p><i>The Shield.</i>&mdash;This was circular and concave and, if
we may credit Herodotus, made of cane. The representations
of this defence bear out the assertion, however,
for the front is generally marked out in concentric circles,
and wherever the back is exhibited the same circles invariably
appear. The light and tough nature of the
material would strongly commend itself for this purpose.
Occasionally shields are shown covered with leather, or
one plate of metal, while others have a surface covered
with lozenges, which doubtless represents a kind of pourpoint
or quilted material stretched over the framework.</p>

<p><i>The Sword.</i>&mdash;The Assyrian sword as delineated upon
the sculptures was slung at the left side, and passed
through two notches in the belt so as to make it assume
a horizontal position.</p>

<p>The sculptures in the British Museum show the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
character of the sword (or rather of the scabbard, for they
are all sheathed) with great minuteness. The pommel
is very elegant in form and generally carved; the grip is
of peculiar formation, and there is no guard; from actual
examples which have been found we know that the
broad blade has two edges and terminates in a point. The
scabbard is extremely artistic in form, and the whole
weapon partakes more of the nature of the dagger or
anelace than of the sword.</p>

<p><i>The Bow</i> was a favourite weapon and of the usual
Oriental pattern, being composed of horn, wood, and the
large sinews of certain animals firmly glued together. It
was carried partly unstrung over the shoulder when not
in use; the total unstringing was not advisable because
of the time occupied in getting it ready, most Asiatic
bows bending backwards into an oval shape when unstrung,
and requiring much physical exertion and time
to replace the string. The quiver was also suspended in
the same position, containing arrows of some length made
of cane.</p>

<p><i>The Lance</i> was of short proportions, with oblong and
leaf-shaped heads, often unbarbed; it could be thrown, if
desired, like a javelin. The mace is also shown upon the
sculptures, but rarely.</p>

<h3>THE EGYPTIANS</h3>

<p><i>The Tunic.</i>&mdash;This was invariably of a quilted material,
thickly padded, and generally composed of linen several
times folded; it could resist a cutting weapon but not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
point of a sword or lance. Over it was placed the pectoral,
which covered the shoulders as well as the chest, and was
very similar to the mediæval camail.</p>

<p><i>The Helmet</i> was of the semi-globular form as a basis
with various additions, none, however, of a distinctive
national character. The material used was quilted linen
of many thicknesses glued together.</p>

<p><i>The Shield</i> was used only by the spearmen, and was
about a yard in height; it was of peculiar shape, being
rectangular in the lower part and semi-circular in the upper,
where a round opening was pierced, through which the
approach of the enemy could be viewed with safety. The
outer parts were covered with leather strengthened with
rings and studs.</p>

<p><i>The Bow.</i>&mdash;The main strength of the Egyptian armies
lay in their bowmen, who fought from chariots or on foot.
English pattern than the Oriental, as also did the arrow,
which was at times over 30 inches in length. The latter
was made of cane or reed, feathered and barbed, the heads
being of bronze.</p>

<p><i>The Spearmen</i> or heavily-armed troops were accoutred
in cuirasses of bronze scales overlapping, and supported on
the shoulders by straps; or else in short tunics of heavily-quilted
material with bronze plates sewn on in a pattern.
Their helmets were quilted like the tunics.</p>

<p>Various weapons appear to have been used by the
Egyptians, but they were all secondary to the bow and spear.
The sword was straight, double-edged, tapering from the
hilt to the point, and constructed of bronze. Scimitars,
daggers, battle-axes of various shapes, and slings were in
use, while a speciality seems to have been made of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
javelin, which was hurled by means of a stick.</p>

<h3>THE GREEKS</h3>

<p>For the better understanding of the arms of the Greeks
it is desirable to consider those of the two distinct ages into
which their history naturally falls, viz. the Heroic and the
Historic.</p>

<h4>THE HEROIC AGE</h4>

<p>This period is approximately 1000 years <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, of the
time of Homer, from whom we obtain all, or nearly all,
of the particulars respecting arms and armour.</p>

<p><i>The Cuirass.</i>&mdash;This was made of bronze, as was the whole
of the defensive armour at that time. It was worn over a
linen tunic, and apparently consisted of a breastplate guarded
round the arms and neck with lames. That of Agamemnon
is stated to have had ten bands of bronze, twelve of
gold, twenty of tin, and six of bronze round the neck. We
have mention of the defensive equipment of Menelaus which
was pierced by the arrow of Pandarus. It first passed
through the golden clasps of the waist-belt, then the breastplate,
and finally through a coat of mail which was worn
underneath. The cuirass was often very highly ornamented
by repoussé work and also inlaid with gold.</p>

<p><i>The Helmet.</i>&mdash;The most elaborate helms were those
fitting lightly to the head and adorned with a crest which
projected before and behind, and was also furnished with
plumes. The simpler forms were of leather or bronze,
fitting closely to the head, and without peak or plume.</p>

(front and back view).</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>
<p><i>The Greaves</i> covered the legs from the knee to the
instep, and from their form must have been constructed
of bronze or some alloy possessing a
large amount of pliability, inasmuch as
they were in one piece, and yet nearly
met behind the legs, where they were
fastened with clasps. Homer frequently
alludes to the excellent way in which
these defences were made, whereby they
in no way hindered the wearer (<a href="#fig31">Fig.
31</a>). It is conjectured that the bronze
used in the construction of the greaves
resembled in some respects the hardened brass or “latten”
of the mediæval ages, and that they were carefully moulded
to the limbs of the wearer.</p>

<p><i>The Shield</i>, by far the most important part of the
defence, was either round or oval in form and made of
bronze, protected at the back with hide, and at times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
covered with it. Strengthening discs of metal, bosses,
and rings of metal were also added (Figs. <a href="#fig32">32</a>, <a href="#fig33">33</a>). It
appears to have been of very great weight, even Ajax
on one occasion being embarrassed by the weight of his
own shield, which we are told was of
bronze backed by seven tough bulls’
hides. They reached from the neck to
the ankle, and were often elaborately
decorated. A guige appears to have
been fitted at times, which passed over
the right shoulder.</p>

<p><i>The Sword.</i>&mdash;Homer applies the
terms “long, large, sharp, trenchant,
and two-edged” to the sword, and it
is evident that it was of the same
description as that characteristic of the Bronze Age
(<a href="#fig34">Fig. 34</a>). It was ornamented with studs of gold or
silver, and the sword-belt was apparently worn over the
shoulder.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 35.&mdash;Greek
bow.</p>
</div>

<p><i>The Lance or Javelin.</i>&mdash;This was by far the most
important weapon in the Grecian armoury, and plays the
chief part in all Homeric combats, which commence
by the spear being poised in the hand and hurled as a
javelin. It decided the contest as a rule, and it was
only upon its failing to do so that the combatants had
recourse to the sword. The lance was made of ash&mdash;long,
tough, and ponderous; the head was of bronze and
unbarbed.</p>

<p><i>The Bow.</i>&mdash;Only one description of a bow is given
to us&mdash;that of Pandarus, which is said to be of ibex horn,
strung with sinews (<a href="#fig35">Fig. 35</a>). The arrow-head is of iron;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
the only mention of that metal in the warrior’s equipment,
and the arrows were kept in a quiver fitted with a
lid. The sling appears to have been relegated
to the lowest order of combatants, who occupied
the rear of the army, and sent their missiles
over the heads of those in front. The great
chiefs and the spearmen did not disdain to use
the stone upon occasion, and we have graphic
descriptions of the huge rocky pieces the combatants
hurled at one another.</p>


<h4>THE HISTORIC AGE</h4>

<p>The equipment described by Homer had not
particularly altered in the Iron Age except in
certain details and modifications necessitated by
the changed order of combat. The heavily-armed
soldier, having already a tunic as a
<i>just-au-corps</i>, put on greaves, cuirass, sword (hung upon
the left side by a belt passing over the right shoulder);
the large round shield, supported in the same manner,
helmet, and spear, or two spears, as occasion required.
Men thus equipped were termed Hoplites, the term
“hopla” more especially denoting the defensive armour,
the shield and breastplate, or cuirass. The mode of combat
by the Greek phalanx necessitated the adoption of a long
and heavy spear; the ranks were sixteen deep, and each
rank consisted of the men standing close together with
shield touching shield, while the spears or pikes, each
24 feet in length, reached 18 feet in front of the near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>est
rank when couched. As a space of about 2 feet was
allowed between each rank, the spears of the five files
behind him projected in advance of each front-rank man.</p>

<p>The sword continued to be of the leaf-like form which
prevailed in the Bronze Age, and was longer than the
Roman sword of the following era. At the same time a
sword was in use which was the prototype of the subsequent
weapon: it had a long, straight blade slightly tapering
from the hilt to the point, where it was cut to an acute
angle for thrusting. A central ridge traversed both sides
of the blade, and it was double-edged. Upon these swords
and their scabbards a wealth of decoration was lavished
by the Greeks. The great shield of the Heroic Age gave
place to a round or oblong shield reaching only to the knee;
it was concave to the body, and appears to have been
decorated as a general rule: one invariable ornament was a
flat band or border round the circumference. This shield
was the true battle-shield of the heavily-armed hoplites. A
much smaller and lighter one was used by the cavalry and
the light infantry, being made of hide with the hair on. A
cross-piece was affixed at the back for a handle, and a cord
was looped round the inside of the shield, which afforded
a grasp for the hand.</p>

<p>The helms all appear with characteristic neck-guards
and pendent guards for the face, which were free to move
upon simple attachments at the side; the front is shown
to be protected by a more or less ornamental visor or nasal.
The crest, of which three distinct varieties are shown,
assumed many modifications of those varieties, but the
general arrangement was to lengthen it so as to extend from
the front portion of the helmet to the neck-guard, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
the upper portion spreading like a fan. The body of the
helm in nearly every instance was made the ground for
elaborate decoration. To the crest was added at times one
or two plumes, the whole producing a striking military effect
(Figs. <a href="#fig36">36</a> and <a href="#fig37">37</a>). The true Greek war-helm, however, had
very little exterior ornamentation, but was in every respect
a most serviceable and business-like headpiece. It was
known as the Bœotian helm (<a href="#fig38">Fig. 38</a>), and the general shape
may be gathered from an examination of the Italian “barbuta”
of the fourteenth century, its lineal descendant. A
fine helmet of this character is preserved in Case 24 at the
Tower of London; it is of bronze, and was excavated at
Cumæ, an ancient Greek colony near Naples. It is shown
in <a href="#fig39">Fig. 39</a>. Fitting closely to the head and neck, the lower
part reached to the shoulders; in front two openings for
the eyes, with a drooping nasal between and a narrow
vertical opening opposite the chin and neck, gave a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>general
protection which was most effectual, and only exposed the
absolute minimum to chance of injury. Its efficacy was
soon recognised, and it was eagerly assumed
by the hoplites and the leading Greek
warriors. The greaves now appear without
straps behind, and were retained in their
place solely by the elasticity of the metal;
they are represented as adhering closely to
the limb, and were probably moulded from
casts taken direct from the wearer. About
400 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> the heavy bronze cuirass of the
Greek soldier, which had been transmitted
from the Heroic Period, gave way to a
lighter but equally efficacious defence, made
of linen crossed many times in folds and
glued together, such as we have seen used
by the Egyptians, and, in fact, by nearly all
Asiatic races. The mounted soldiers wore a shorter cuirass
than the hoplites; it was moulded to the figure, and from
the lower edge pendent straps of leather were affixed for
the protection of the lower part of the body and the thig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>hs.
These “lambrequins,” as they were termed, were very
numerous, and at times ornamented with metal plaques;
they were longer than the Roman lambrequins of a subsequent
period by reason of the Greek cuirass terminating
at the waist (Figs. <a href="#fig40">40</a> and <a href="#fig41">41</a>). The javelin or throwing-spear
of the light-armed troops was furnished with a strap
to aid in propelling it. A pair of Greek greaves are preserved
in Case 24, Tower of London, which are probably
of the Heroic Age, as they are furnished with rings for the
attachment of fastening straps. From the same case we
have examples of the bronze cuirass, backplate, and breastplate,
with a bronze attachment at one shoulder for fastening
the two together. An outline of the chief muscles and
prominences upon the human form are crudely imitated in
repoussé work, and indications exist upon the backplate

(<a href="#fig39">Fig. 39</a>). The bronze belt or zone which was worn by

amount of artistic skill. To this zone were
attached the lower defences for body and limbs.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>The Greek dagger was termed the “parazonium,” and
was common to all the troops (<a href="#fig43">Fig. 43</a>): it was broad
in the blade and came to an acute point, the general
shape of the blade being of a leaf-like outline similar
to the sword. This shape was subsequently adopted by
the Romans. A dagger and sheath from Cumæ differs
in form from the foregoing (<a href="#fig42">Fig. 42</a>), and partakes more
of the character of the anelace of the mediæval period.
The holes are shown for rivets by which the wooden or
bone handle was fastened, and the sheath, which is very
plain, terminates in a small knob. The dagger had a sma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>ll
shoulder-strap of its own, by which it was suspended at the
right side in a sloping position
much higher than the waist.</p>

<p>The bow was of the short
form, and made of the same
materials as those used in the
Heroic Age. A quiver was in
general use by the Greek archers,
which contained both bow and
arrows, as in <a href="#fig44">Fig. 44</a>, which is
shown with its accompanying
strap. This, however, was not always the case, as quivers
are shown for arrows alone, as in <a href="#fig45">Fig. 45</a>, and also bow-cases
which are not adapted for arrows as well (<a href="#fig46">Fig. 46</a>).</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 47.&mdash;Etruscan helmet.</p>
</div>

<p>With regard to the arms and armour of the Etruscans
we find but little difference existing from those of the
Greeks, but certain developments occurred
which distinguished them from those of
the parent country and were subsequently
adopted by the Romans, thus laying the
foundation for a separate and distinct style
of equipment. The helmet in general followed
the Greek lines but had a tendency towards the
formation of a deep bowl-shape for the head; also wings
were adopted, at times, which projected to a considerable
extent and gave a distinctly Asiatic character to the headpiece
(<a href="#fig47">Fig. 47</a>). For the ordinary soldier a skull-cap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
was in use with a truncated point upon the summit, and
ornamented bosses round the rim (<a href="#fig48">Fig. 48</a>).</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 48.&mdash;Etruscan
soldier’s helmet.</p>
</div>

<p>The cuirass with its dependent lambrequins was formed,
like that of the Greeks, by joining a back- and breast-plate,
but the overlapping shoulder-guards, with a tendency
to meet in front, so often observed upon Etruscan pottery,
are quite distinct from the Greek model (<a href="#fig49">Fig. 49</a>).
Cuirasses are also shown made of overlapping plates of
metal (<a href="#fig50">Fig. 50</a>); of discs or lames of plate sewn on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
padded base (<a href="#fig51">Fig. 51</a>); and one quilted throughout apparently
without any metallic defence
(<a href="#fig52">Fig. 52</a>). It has the thorax
attached to it, and being viewed
from behind exhibits that protection,
as is also the case in <a href="#fig51">Fig. 51</a>.
As a rule greaves were not worn,
the limbs being entirely unprotected.
The archers had a cap
similar to <a href="#fig48">Fig. 48</a>, together with
a tunic of leather. The bow in
use was of a very simple form, as shown in <a href="#fig53">Fig. 53</a>.
The shield was circular, and similar in outline to that of
the Greek, but differed in its great convexity; the one
shown in <a href="#fig54">Fig. 54</a> exhibits the interior, with the method
of affixing the handle.</p>

<h3>THE ROMANS</h3>


<p>The defensive armour of the Romans differed essentially
in the early form from the later, or, broadly speaking,
between the Republican Period and the Imperial Period;
though it overlapped considerably
it may be as well to accept
these periods for differentiation.</p>


<h4>REPUBLICAN ARMOUR</h4>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 145px;">
<a id="fig55" name="fig55"></a>
<img src="images/fig055.jpg" width="145" height="200" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 55.&mdash;Lorica of Roman General
(Republican).</p>
</div>

<p><i>Cuirass or Lorica.</i>&mdash;This was
formed upon the Greek style of
armour based upon the Etruscan
model, and consisted of a back- and
breast-plate, strapped together
at the sides and fastened by broad
epaulette-like belts upon the
shoulders (<a href="#fig55">Fig. 55</a>). These belts
fastened in front to a ring attached
to the breastplate, and were permanently fixed, low down
over the shoulder-blades behind. The lorica was of bronze,
and modelled to the shape of the figure; short straps of
leather were fixed at the arm-openings, which fell over
the shoulders; at the lower part of the cuirass there were
two bands of leather, one showing underneath the other,
and both generally dagged at the edges; below this again
depended the lambrequins, often covered with metal studs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
or plates, and sometimes curled and plaited. They were
of the same shape as the shoulder-pieces, but much broader,
and always of leather. The tunic worn under the cuirass
had half sleeves, and its lower border
reached nearly as low as the lambrequins.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 110px;">
<a id="fig56" name="fig56"></a>
<img src="images/fig056.jpg" width="110" height="150" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 56.&mdash;Roman
helmet (Imperial
Period).</p>
</div>

<p>The military cloak or paludamentum
was draped over the cuirass in picturesque
folds, varying according to the taste of the
individual wearer.</p>

<p><i>The Helmet</i> was very similar to the
Greek model, and had a crest and cheek-pieces
(<a href="#fig56">Fig. 56</a>).</p>

<p>The Roman leaders often affected the
laminated cuirass, or else that composed of overlapping
scales of bronze (<a href="#fig57">Fig. 57</a>). The shield was made upon the
Greek model, and the weapons
consisted of the lance, javelin,
and sword.</p>

<h4>THE IMPERIAL PERIOD</h4>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 57.&mdash;Officers lorica (Republican
Period).</p>
</div>

<p>With the advent of the emperors
our knowledge becomes
of a more definite character.
The admission of foreigners into
the Roman army, although it
had proved disastrous to the
republic, was continued by the emperors, and not only
were the natives of the conquered countries enlisted but
also mercenaries were employed.</p>

<p>Consequently a great variety of armour and arms
existed in the Roman armies, but the essential <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>ones stand
out prominently in sculptures, painting, and upon coins,
&amp;c., and with these only will we deal.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 156px;">

<img src="images/fig058.jpg" width="156" height="200" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 58.&mdash;Roman laminated
cuirass.</p>
</div>

<p><i>The Cuirass.</i>&mdash;The heavily-armed troops bore the
laminated cuirass (<a href="#fig58">Fig. 58</a>), which consisted of about
seven lames of steel encircling the trunk, each lame being
divided into two portions, which joined in the middle of
the back and in front. Affixed to the
top lame, back and front, were four or
more bowed lames passing over the
shoulders and working freely upon the
pivots which secured them. In front,
and fixed to the lower part of the
second lame from the bottom, were
three or four short lames pendent and
hanging vertically so as to protect the
middle of the body below the waist.
The lames encircling the body were
sewn down to a tightly-fitting leather garment, the true
cuirass, which was continued upwards before and behind
in order to protect the chest and throat and passed over
the shoulders under the curved lames. The whole cuirass
opened down the front, the iron bands being hinged
behind, fastening with a clasp in front. To the lowest
lame was generally affixed two rows of leather, dagged
at their edges, and the lambrequins descended beneath
them, one row of the straps being shorter than those
beneath, which fell lower than those used in the earlier
age.</p>

<p>The officer of the Imperial Period affected the lorica
modelled to the figure as worn by the soldiers in the
Republican Period, but considerably shortened and sel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>dom
reaching below the waist, but the scaled cuirass was also
a favourite.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 60.&mdash;Roman
helmet.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p><i>The Helmet</i> of the soldier was simply a skull-cap
with a peak and pendent cheek-guards (<a href="#fig59">Fig. 59</a>), but subsequently
was furnished with a descending hollowed neck-guard,
a bar across the forehead acting as a visor, and two
cheek-pieces, hinged, which could be fastened together
beneath the chin (<a href="#fig60">Fig. 60</a>). During the later days of
the empire the helmet became
deeper. A common
form of ornament for the
crest was simply a round
knob.</p>

<p><i>The Shield.</i>&mdash;This was of
two distinct kinds, a long,
rectangular, and very concave shield borne only by the
legionaries, and an oval, flattened form carried by the
horsemen. The rectangular shield was about two feet
six inches long, and composed of two plates of metal
overlapping, with bands of metal strengthening it at the
top and also at the lower edge, where it often rested
on the ground. With this shield the well-known testudo
was formed. The cognisance of the legion appeared upon
the outer face, and on the column of Trajan, where members
of the “thundering legion” are depicted, the device is
that of a conventional thunderbolt of the usual zigzag
description. The oval shield carried by the cavalry (the
equites) and the light-armed troops (the velites) was a
much-flattened variety of the old shield, and in the later
years of the empire was adopted by the legionaries when
the rectangular shield was discarded; it was, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
considerably enlarged in its later form.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 61.&mdash;Roman swords.</p>
</div>

<p><i>The Sword.</i>&mdash;The early sword, like that of most nations,
was of bronze of the well-known leaf shape, and, compared
with those of other nations, comparatively short.
In the first century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> it had become modified into a
weapon about two feet in length, having a two-edged
blade with parallel sides, and the point at an obtuse angle
(<a href="#fig61">Fig. 61</a>). A short cross-guard,
thin grip, and swelling
pommel completed this
remarkable weapon, which
when used against adversaries
armed with lance,
javelin, or a long sword
must have necessitated the
Roman legionary getting within the guard of his adversary
before being able to use his weapon, thus implying
a high degree of personal bravery. It was worn upon the
right side, suspended from a shoulder-belt. Upon the
Trajan column, dating from 114 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, the sword appears
much longer than in earlier representations, and shortly
afterwards a long single-edged sword called the “spatha”
was in use side by side with the short sword.</p>

<p class="right"><i>A. F. Calvert</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>The Spear.</i>&mdash;“The spear that conquered the world,”
as a French author defines it, was the redoubtable
<i>pilum</i>, concerning which much has been written and
much disputation has arisen. It is most remarkable that
a weapon which is constantly alluded to as the essential
arm of the Roman warrior, and which has been fully described
by a writer, should be of such extreme rarity that
its very form has provided matter for discussion a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>nd
dispute. The description of the pilum by Polybius, who
flourished in the second century before Christ, is comprehensive
and distinct, but owing to the lack of representations
and of actual models, much misconception has
arisen concerning the exact meaning of his words. He
describes it as a weapon having a very large iron head,
which was furnished with a socket to receive the wooden
shafts. The socket was about a third of the length of
the weapon, and the barbed head of the same length.
In the Museum at Wiesbaden there is a reputed pilum,
but the marvel is that there do not exist hundreds of
examples of a weapon with which combats without number
have been fought over an area equal to the half of
Europe.</p>

<p>The large iron head mentioned by Polybius is an
obtusely pointed pike-head with three or four barbs projecting
backwards to a short distance from the head;
behind the head is the neck, which, though long and slender,
is capable of resisting a considerable amount of violent
usage. This neck is about twenty inches in length, and
at its base swells into a socket for the shaft, and encases
the latter for a good portion of its length, being fitted
with extreme care. The whole weapon was about six feet
nine inches to seven feet in length, and may be described
as one-third visible shaft, one-third shaft in iron socket,
and the remainder a slender iron rod bearing a large head.
It will readily be seen that, owing to the uncased shaft
at the base, the centre of gravity would lie between the
middle portion of the weapon and the head, thus adapting
it for throwing purposes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>
<p>The particular purpose of the pilum was to deprive
an adversary of his shield. The method adopted was to
approach within throwing distance and hurl the massive
weapon at an opponent, who would naturally interpose his
shield in defence; if the head crashed through the shield
the object was accomplished, for owing to its form withdrawal
was impossible, while the heavy shaft prevented
any advance, and at the same time hindered retreat. To
prevent the probability of either, however, the legionary
with sword and shield promptly fell upon his embarrassed
adversary, and there could be but one ending to such an
unequal combat. For use at close quarters it was also
equally efficacious, for, wielded with both hands like a
mediæval pike, it could resist with ease the sword-cuts of
the enemy; indeed Polybius tells us that the legionary
received the sword-cuts of the enemy with calm confidence
on his pilum, which resisted them with ease, while the
adversary’s weapon was cut and hacked into the mere
semblance of a strigil, or skin-scraper. This weapon was
essentially Roman, and the troops wielding it were known
as <i>pilani</i>. The cavalry carried a long and slender lance
furnished with the <i>amentum</i>, a leather thong fitted nearly
two-thirds of the length of the spear from the butt, being
the centre of gravity of the shaft. This thong was of
great use in propelling the spear when used as a javelin.
The Roman dart was about three feet in length, and fitted
with an extremely thin point about six inches long;
upon striking any obstacle the point became so bent and
distorted that it was of no use for hurling back again at
the enemy. The light-armed troops also possessed a spear
which was about four and a half feet in length.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE FRANKS</h3>

<p class="noindent">were a nation of Germanic origin, and originally
occupied the land lying upon the north bank of the Rhine,
stretching from Mayence almost to the sea. They successfully
resisted the advance of the Romans in the second
and third centuries, and eventually began an aggressive
migration southwards, which finally resulted in the subjugation
of the modern countries of Holland, Belgium,
France, and partly of Germany and Italy. Long before
this consummation, however, we find that the Franks
freely enlisted in the Roman armies, and eventually formed
the bulwark between the western dominions of the
Romans and the fierce barbarian hordes who poured down
from the north in almost overwhelming numbers. History
teems with examples of their prowess as a military
nation; their large stature, bold and wild aspect, and
utter fearlessness, rendering them at first most formidable
opponents of the comparatively little men of the native
Roman armies, and equally valuable allies afterwards. As
a Teutonic race we naturally expect to find them armed
with the weapons characteristic of the northern tribes.</p>

<p><i>The Francisca.</i>&mdash;Under the Merovingian dynasty, from
the fifth to the eighth century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, the Franks used a
weapon in their warfare which has become associated with
their name. The <i>francisca</i>, or battle-axe, was a heavy
missile weapon which has been described by Procopius as
having a very broad blade and a short handle, but so many
varieties have been found that we must infer that his description
was simply a broad and general one. Thus some are
long and narrow in the blade and only slightly cu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>rved, and
some have a cutting projection of various shapes upon
the back portion of the axe-head. In use it was thrown
with tremendous force and unerring aim at an enemy,
the Frank being able to accomplish this because of the
freedom from embarrassing armour or clinging garments
which he enjoyed, and also, owing to constant practice, the
distance to which it was hurled was a very remarkable
feature. So heavy and strong was this formidable missile
that a shield was invariably crushed in or cut through, if
interposed, whilst a blow received upon the person inevitably
ended in death. If used in the hand the weapon
was of the same terrible character. It is questionable
whether the bipennis, or double-headed axe, ever found
great favour with the Franks, although it has been attributed
to them.</p>

<p><i>The Lance</i>, sometimes termed the <i>framea</i>, appears to
have been a weapon chiefly associated with the cavalry, and
not differing in any essential points from that generally
carried by horsemen at the time. The head was of many
forms, and the socket always an integral part of it; the latter
extended to a distance of eighteen inches or more from the
head, and was hollowed to receive the shaft, being fixed
in position by a rivet which passed through the wood and
also through two holes in opposite sides of the socket.</p>

<p><i>The Angon.</i>&mdash;The angon was both in form and in use
similar to the pilum of the Romans. It had a barbed head
and a long, slender neck of iron, one found in Germany
being over a yard in length. A socket fitted over a heavy
shaft, and the whole weapon had a length of about six feet.
In use the angon was hurled at the enemy in order to
pierce his body or his shield; if the latter occurre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>d the
soldier was practically deprived of his defence, as he could
neither advance nor retreat with such an incubus fixed in
it. The Frankish warrior, however, quickly seized the
advantage thus gained, and rushing forward deliberately
trod upon his weapon, thus dragging the shield out of
the hands of his opponent who, being left comparatively
defenceless, was easily overcome with axe or sword.</p>

<p><i>The Sword.</i>&mdash;The Frankish sword was about thirty
inches in length; the blade was broad, straight, and double-edged,
with parallel sides ending abruptly in a somewhat
obtuse point. It had a very short cross-bar as a guard, a
straight grip, and a small, slightly swelling pommel. The
scabbard, constructed of either wood or iron, was decorated
with plates of inlaid work, generally in copper. This sword
does not appear to have been universal in the army, but
to have been appropriated by those having an official position.
What may be termed a large knife, or a long
and heavy dagger, also formed a characteristic Frankish
weapon.</p>

<p>With regard to the defensive equipment of the Franks
we are in some degree of doubt, inasmuch as no national
armour was evolved. In the earlier part of their history
they appeared to have disdained any defence but the shield,
but in the time of Charlemagne a simple hauberk of pourpoint
was worn, covered more or less with metal plates,
and a leathern cap upon the head. The shield was of metal
and circular, with a central projecting boss or umbo similar
to that of the Saxons. The soldiers forming the élite of
the army were provided with an equipment which was a
modified form of that worn by the Roman legionaries.
The earlier Franks appear to have been a nation of i<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>nfantry,
but in the Carlovingian period they developed qualities of
horsemanship which eventually led to their army being
exceptionally rich in cavalry, almost one half of their force
subsequently being classed under this heading.</p>

<h3>SAXONS AND DANES</h3>


<p>The military equipment of our Saxon and Danish forefathers
is of much interest to us as a nation, inasmuch as we are
curious to ascertain with what weapons and with what
personal defences our ancestors were able, apart from personal
courage, to overcome the fierce opposition of the Romanised
Britons. That this resistance was of a formidable character
we may judge from the extended time occupied in the conquest
of England, running into hundreds of years and
necessitating waves of invasion. They won the country
bit by bit, and the conquered were effectually displaced by
the invaders; so thorough was this that practically the
Britons disappeared before the warlike Teutons, whereby all
their traces of occupation were wiped out and only the great
works of engineering or building skill of those “who built
for eternity, and not for time,” resisted their devastating
march. It is probable that during the many centuries of
Roman occupation many of the Britons had learned the
method of warfare and the use of the weapons of their conquerors;
and we know that British recruits for the Roman
armies were in considerable demand. Consequently we
may fairly assume that the Saxons were opposed by Roman
swords, spears, and javelins, and that a certain amount of
Roman armour protected the defenders. To this equipment
we may ascribe the fierce and prolonged resistance
offered to the invaders, who were only able to fou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>nd their
first petty kingdom, that of Kent, after a struggle of nearly
forty years’ duration.</p>

<p><i>The Saxon Spear.</i>&mdash;The chief weapon of offence among
the Saxons was undoubtedly the spear, which was of two
kinds&mdash;the longer, used by the cavalry, or in certain cases
to be employed against them, and the shorter, which partook
of the dual nature of a spear and of a javelin.</p>

<p>The chief authorities for Saxon arms and armour are (<i>a</i>)
the illuminated manuscripts preserved in the British Museum,
the Bodleian Library, &amp;c., some of which date back to the
eighth century or even earlier; (<i>b</i>) the written description of
the equipment of certain warriors of a still more remote
period; and (<i>c</i>) the sagas, most of them of a warlike nature,
which not only laud the heroic deeds of warriors but
constantly refer to the weapons and armour borne by them.
But these details, necessarily crude and by themselves to a
certain extent unreliable, are fortunately supplemented by
actual examples which have been found in Saxon barrows
all over the country and preserved in many museums, from
which we are enabled to verify the illuminations and
descriptions.</p>

<p>A spear is found as a rule in all Saxon interments, or
more strictly speaking the iron head, the wooden portion
having generally decayed. From numberless references to
the latter we find that it was invariably made of ash, and
the warrior is often poetically referred to as the “ash-bearer.”
The shorter kind is found in barrows, doubtless because of
limitation of space, and so commonly do they occur, that
probably every Saxon, from freeman upwards, was interred
with one. They are sometimes found reversed, with the
iron head near the feet, and the hollow shoe or butto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>n which
protected the end of the shaft near the skull. From many
measurements taken from the head of the spear to the
shoe, the total length of the shorter kind has been found
to be about six feet.</p>

<p>In some places portions of the wood have been found
still preserved; these have been tested and proved to be of
ash wood, but in no case have these remains demonstrated
that the shaft was excessively thin as is represented in illuminations,
where as a rule only a narrow ruled line is drawn
for the shaft. Judging from the numerous illustrations of
mounted horsemen with which the MSS. abound, the length
of the longer variety was about nine or ten feet. The
accompanying illustration (<a href="#fig62">Fig. 62</a>) represents various forms
of spear-heads copied from Saxon MSS. in the British
Museum, from which it will be seen that no stereotyped
pattern was in vogue, but that almost every variety of
possible form was brought into use. That which at once
attracts the attention is the form of guard invariably used
below the spear-head, and which was doubtless intended to
ward off sword-cuts which might possibly sever the shaft.
They were of iron, and sometimes as many as three were
in use. In two of these examples the barbed form of head
is shown, which is the most uncommon, both in illustrations
and also in actual finds in barrows. Probably this form
was generally in use for javelins, the other variety being
easily withdrawn after inflicting a wound. In <a href="#fig63">Fig. 63</a>,
which presents examples of actual spear-heads found in
Great Britain, we notice that the shaft is fixed in a socket
which is always furnished with a longitudinal slit. Nails or
rivets were used to fasten it to the shaft. The absence of
the cross guards should be noticed; probably they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
inserted in the shaft and formed no integral part of the
spear-head. In the Tower Collection, however, is a spear-head,
with a cross-piece similar to the guards shown in
illustrations, which was discovered some time since near
Nottingham. The short spear was not carried singly but
generally in pairs, and at times three are represented;
for instance, in a British Museum MS. the destroying
angel is shown with three javelins, one in flight, one
poised for throwing in the right hand, and one grasped in
the left.</p>

<p><i>The Sword.</i>&mdash;Swords were essentially cavalry weapons
among the Anglo-Saxons, and were not carried by any
person beneath the rank of thane. The earliest of those
found in England have no quillons or cross-pieces, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
merely pommel, grip, and blade. The latter was long,
straight, rounded at the point, and double-edged, 30 inches
long and 2 inches wide at the hilt; the grip was of wood
and with but little swell. The total length is generally
about three feet. Irish swords of the same period are
about six inches shorter; both kinds were provided with
wooden scabbards. Undoubtedly this sword was fashioned
from classical models. During the later Saxon occupation
a cross-piece was added to the weapon; it became more
acutely pointed, and the pommel occasionally showed signs
of ornamentation. No. 2 of <a href="#fig64">Fig. 64</a> is a sword found in
Cambridgeshire, and shows the quillons in an incipient form,
while the addition of a knob to the pommel relieves the
monotony seen in No. 1. No. 3, from the same find, has
the cross-piece enlarged, while the other swords show various
stages of development. The two swords, Nos. 5 and 6,
are from MSS. of the eighth century. A rare example of
the sword of this period is preserved in the Wallace Collection,
and is shown in <a href="#fig65">Fig. 65</a>. It has a flat, crown-shaped
pommel, with five small lobes and short, straight quillons
rounded at the ends, the grip being missing. The blade
is grooved, measures 30¼ inches in length, and shows
traces of an inscription or ornament.</p>

<p>The sword preserved in the British Museum, which was
obtained from the bed of the River Witham, is very similar
to this and is probably contemporary, while another weapon
has recently been found in the Thames with the hilt
upwards which is almost identical with that found in the
Witham. The blades of all three examples are about thirty
inches in length. The grip of the swords appears to have
been made of pine-wood, judging from a few remains which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
have been found. It is more than probable that the wood
was covered with leather, bone, or horn. That the sword-hilts
were at times of a costly character and richly ornamented
we may infer from the Wallace sword, which has
traces of silver work upon the quillons; the British Museum
sword, which has the pommel and quillons inlaid with gold
and copper in a lozenge pattern; and from numerous
references in the MSS. to weapons with hilts of gold or
silver, inlaid work, setting of precious stones, &amp;c., the
illuminations invariably showing the hilts and mountings
of a yellow colour, thus implying gold, or gold plating.
The sheaths were invariably of wood covered with leather,
with ornamental designs painted or stamped upon them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
and mountings of bronze or more costly metal. The sword
is less often found in Saxon graves than the spear, as might
be expected, seeing that its use was confined to the upper
classes.</p>

<p><i>The Axe.</i>&mdash;The axe was a distinctive and characteristic
weapon of the northern nations, and its use by the Anglo-Saxons
is proved by references and illustrations in a few
late MSS. It is therefore possible that the Danes introduced
its extensive use.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>
<p>Its occurrence in interments in this country is extremely
rare, and but very few examples have come to light.
There appears to have been
three varieties in use, the
taper, the broad, and the
double. Examples of the
taper axe, found in Kent,
are engraved in <a href="#fig66">Fig. 66</a>,
Nos. 1 and 4; the broad
axe is shown in Nos. 2
and 3, while a few other
varieties are drawn. The
double axe, or bipennis, very
rarely occurs in illuminations,
and has not been
found in any Anglo-Saxon
grave. Its form is shown
in <a href="#fig62">Fig. 62</a>. The pole-axe
is a variety, and appears
in the hands of the Saxons
at the battle of Hastings.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 67.&mdash;Saxon knives.</p>
</div>

<p style="clear: right;"><i>The Dagger</i> or knife
was a weapon in common
use, and has been found in many Saxon graves. They are
of various sizes, but probably
only those of large dimensions
were weapons, the smaller being
used for domestic purposes. A
fine example from Kent is No. 1
in <a href="#fig67">Fig. 67</a>. It is 16 inches in
length, and provided with a small cross-piece. No. 2 is
also from a Kentish find; Nos. 3 and 4, Irish. No. 4 is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
remarkable by reason of the preservation of the wooden
handle, which shows traces of carving.
The use of the dagger is shown in a
very spirited little sketch taken from
an Anglo-Saxon Psalter of the Duc
de Berri (<a href="#fig68">Fig. 68</a>), where the spearman
has been assailed by a dagger of
the form shown in <a href="#fig67">Fig. 67</a>, No. 3.
The head of the javelin is barbed
in contradistinction to that of the
spear, as previously mentioned. Both
of the combatants appear to be
emerging from the encounter second
best. The long-bow was used by
the Anglo-Saxons, but not extensively,
and but few illustrations are
found in MSS., while examples of
arrow-heads in graves are uncommon;
those illustrated in <a href="#fig69">Fig. 69</a> are from
MSS. chiefly, and but few from finds
in graves. The sling was not extensively
used, although it is occasionally
shown in MSS. The accompanying cut
(<a href="#fig70">Fig. 70</a>) is from the Anglo-Saxon and
Latin Psalter of Boulogne. Other examples
occur in Cott. MS., Claudius
B. IV., and on the Bayeux Tapestry.
Fairly numerous weapons may be cited
as being occasionally in use, such as the bill, the mace,
the pike, the “morning star,” &amp;c., but they were
in their incipient stage, and individual not uni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>versal
favourites.</p>

<p>Respecting the defensive equipment of the Anglo-Saxons
we are forced to the conclusion that the helmet and
the shield were the
principal portions, and
that in numberless
cases these only were
adopted, others being
considered subsidiary
or superfluous. Indeed
in the earlier
periods of the Saxon
occupation they are
invariably represented
with these defences
only, the byrnie, &amp;c.,
being essentially reserved
for the leaders;
but as the nation increased
in prosperity
so the additional defences
were slowly
added.</p>

<p><i>The Saxon Helmet</i> was commonly of the Phrygian
shape, but examples are plentiful of the hemispherical, the
conical, and the combed hemispherical, side by side with the
Phrygian. The foundation of the helmet was a framework
of bronze or iron bands riveted together, of which the
principal was the piece passing round the head, and that
reaching from the forehead over the head to its junction with
the plate at the back. These two were of thicker material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
than the rest. Occasionally the latter band was produced
so as to form a nasal which became universal at the end of
the tenth century. Upon this sub-structure a leather cap of
varying forms was fixed, sometimes
with ornamental additions in leather
crowning it. The commonest form
is seen in <a href="#fig75">Fig. 75</a>, while other varieties
are perceived in Figs. <a href="#fig71">71</a>,
<a href="#fig76">76</a>, and <a href="#fig77">77</a>.</p>

<p><i>The Shield.</i>&mdash;The shield was of
wood covered with leather, invariably
round in shape, but at times oval
and convex. The lime was the
favourite wood used in its construction,
the “yellow linden” being often
mentioned by Saxon poets. The
distinguishing characteristic of this defence was the
central boss or umbo, of which such a large number
have been found in Saxon interments (<a href="#fig73">Fig. 73</a>).
It was a hollow boss of varying form and dimensions,
but generally about six inches in diameter, and projecting
three or four inches from the outer surface<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
of the shield; the wood was cut away to allow of its
being fixed, and across the hollow at the back a piece of
metal was carried, riveted at both ends to the boss.
This formed a grasp for the left
hand by which the shield was
carried, the umbo protecting the
hand from injury. As it was
often spiked there is reason to
suppose that at times the shield
was used as an offensive weapon
(<a href="#fig75">Fig. 75</a>). To strengthen it,
radiating strips of iron or bronze
were occasionally carried from the
umbo to the edges of the shield,
the simplest being a prolongation
of the grip. It was not a heavy
shield, in no way comparable to
those of some other nations.
The mode of carrying the shield
when not in use is seen in <a href="#fig76">Fig. 76</a>.</p>

<p><i>The Byrnie or Battle-Sark</i>
was at times made of leather. In
the figure reproduced from a British Museum MS. (<a href="#fig77">Fig.
77</a>) the coat appears to be of hide with much of the hair
apparently left upon it; its lower edges are dagged, and it
defends the body and a part of the legs, whereas in <a href="#fig78">Fig. 78</a>
the defensive covering appears only upon the upper part
of the body. The byrnie was also made of padded stuff
judging from the illustrations, but the earlier examples
are so excessively crude and inartistic that it is rash to
make authoritative statements. When a forest is indicated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
by four leaves and a twig, a mountain pass by a bulbous
mole-hill, and elaborate Saxon embroidery by half-a-dozen
scattered dots, it will readily be perceived that such a
technical detail as body armour cannot be definitely settled
by these rude drawings. Hence a controversy has arisen,
which can by no means be considered as definitely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
decided, upon the question as to whether the Anglo-Saxons
possessed byrnies of true interlinked chain mail.
Hewitt in his “Ancient Armour” maintains the affirmative,
and contends that the references in the poem of
“Beowulf” to the “twisted breast-net,”
the “hard battle-net,” the “locked
battle-shirt,” the “byrnie twisted with
hands,” the “war byrnie, hard and hand-locked,”
can only mean chain-mail. He
further refers to the Bayeux Tapestry
where a body is being stripped, and
the links show inside the hauberk as
they are represented on the outside.
These arguments certainly carry weight,
but until a <i>bonâ-fide</i> example of Anglo-Saxon manufacture
is brought to light the question must apparently be left
in abeyance. One of the modes of defence concerning
which there is no doubt was the sewing on of separate flat
rings of iron to a tunic of woven material or leather, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
also the covering of the same with metal or leather plates,
either cut into the form of scales and overlapping, or
square or oblong.</p>

<p>A very interesting little group is shown in <a href="#fig79">Fig. 79</a>
from a Saxon MS., Cleopatra B. 4, in the British Museum.
The book is Ælfric’s Paraphrase of the Pentateuch and
Joshua, and the subject of the drawing is the battle of
the three kings against the cities of the plain. One
king is habited in a ringed byrnie which extends to the
knees and half way down the arms; he wields a sword
with a trilobed pommel and short quillons, and defe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>nds
himself with a shield having a spiked umbo. His armour-bearer
carries another shield, but is quite unarmed, his
duty merely being to defend his master. The Phrygian
cap and simple tunic he wears are probably those of
everyday life. The second king has
no defensive armour and no armour-bearer,
unless the figure seen behind
him in a grotesque attitude fulfils that
office. The bifid beards and the characteristic
Saxon wrinkling of the sleeves
should be noticed, as also that the legs
of the group appear to be bare.</p>

<p>The leg-bands seen upon the Saxon
soldiery were similar to those worn by
all civilians, and adjusted in the same
manner; if, however, they were of
leather instead of the usual textile
fabric a certain amount of defence
could be obtained (Figs. <a href="#fig77">77</a> and <a href="#fig80">80</a>).
It is curious to observe that a number
of soldiers are habited precisely as the civilians, with no
other defences than the helmet and the shield, from which
we conclude that the Anglo-Saxon of an early period
simply dropped his implements of husbandry at the call to
arms and took up the shield, helmet, and the spear.</p>

<p>Towards the latter end of the Saxon period the arms and
armour became almost identical with that in use on the
Continent owing to the constant intercourse which occurred
in the reign of Edward the Confessor, so that in 1066 the
difference in accoutrement was simply small matters of detail.</p>

<h4>THE DANES</h4>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">

<img src="images/fig081.jpg" width="250" height="250" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 81.&mdash;Danish helmet, shield, and sword.</p>
</div>

<p>The military equipment of the Danes was very similar
to that of other northern Teutonic nations, and no single
piece of their arms and armour has been immortalised as
of special significance with the single exception of the
Danish axe. Upon their
first appearance in England
the only armour
worn was a defence for
the chest, consisting of
a broad collar encircling
the neck, with depending
pieces upon which were
sewn flat rings, plates of
metal, horn, &amp;c. In addition
to this pectoral, if it
may be so termed, greaves
were used, consisting of
stout pieces of leather affixed after the form of shin-pieces,
and, judging by representations in illuminated MSS.,
carefully moulded to the limb, inasmuch as the prominent
muscles are shown upon them. This was probably effected
by boiling the leather and subsequently pressing it into
shape. After their settlement in England they gradually
adopted other defences in imitation of the Saxons, but
more especially of the Normans, until their equipment in
the first half of the eleventh century became in every
respect a replica of that of the latter nation.</p>

<p>The Danish helmet in its early form was a close-fitting
skull-cap fitting well down into the back of the neck; upon
this as a foundation the chiefs wore protruding horns, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
at times wings of metal, imparting a highly-ornamental
aspect to the headpiece. Later a conical helmet having
a knob upon the top and being made of metal or leather,
or a mixture of both, was adopted; this in its fully-developed
state was fitted with a nasal (<a href="#fig81">Fig. 81</a>).</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 82.&mdash;Danish weapons.</p>
</div>

<p>The shield is reputed to have been of the shape shown
in <a href="#fig81">Fig. 81</a>, which is taken from the prayer-book of King
Canute, MSS., Cal. A. 7, in the
British Museum. Presuming that
the illuminator has not allowed his
imagination to run riot we must
admire the highly ornamental form
there delineated, evidently founded
upon the universal circular shield of
the Teutonic nations.</p>

<p>The Danish sword was similar to
that of the Anglo-Saxons, and differed only in the scabbard,
upon which more labour was spent in ornamentation.</p>

<p>The spear illustrated (<a href="#fig82">Fig. 82</a>, No. 2) is that of Canute
as shown upon his coins, while the companion weapon is
that of the ordinary soldiery.</p>

<p>The Danish axe (<a href="#fig82">Fig. 82</a>, No. 3) was the famed
bipennis, consisting of two axe-blades of similar form on
either side of the shaft, which latter in a few cases was
furnished with a spike. The axe could be used as a pole-axe
for close combat, or, if furnished with a shorter handle,
be hurled in a similar way to the francisca. A variation
of the bipennis is seen in the companion axe, which is
furnished upon one side with a diamond-pointed cutting
blade of steel in substitution for the axe-blade.</p>

<h3>THE NORMAN PERIOD TO 1180</h3>


<p>With the advent of the Normans in 1066 the subject of
arms and armour in England becomes more definite and
exact. This is chiefly owing to the Bayeux Tapestry, to
the multiplication of MSS., carvings in ivory and metal,
and the records preserved upon seals. The date of the
famous tapestry has long been a matter of dispute, but it
is universally agreed that if it was not woven by Matilda
and her handmaidens it was certainly begun and completed
within fifty years of the Conquest.
Hence its reliability is undoubted
upon contemporaneous arms and
armour.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 119px;">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 83.&mdash;Norman pennons
(Bayeux Tapestry).</p>
</div>

<p><i>The Lance.</i>&mdash;The head of the
lance was commonly of the leaf form,
and sometimes approached that of the
lozenge; it was very seldom barbed,
although this variety, together with
the others, appears upon the Bayeux
Tapestry. The horizontal bar-guards,
so characteristic of the Anglo-Saxon spear, are very rarely
pictured; they were not, however, relinquished by the conquered
nation, but are seen at times in MSS. written
subsequently to the Conquest. Nearly all the Norman
spears were embellished with pennons of from two to five
points (<a href="#fig83">Fig. 83</a>). The length of the spear appears to hav<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>e
differed little from that of the Anglo-Saxon, and like that
weapon they were of uniform thickness
throughout (Figs. <a href="#fig88">88</a>, <a href="#fig91">91</a>, <a href="#fig92">92</a>, <a href="#fig93">93</a>, &amp;c.).</p>

“Massacre of the Innocents.”
(Cott. MS.,
Nero, C. 4, <i>c.</i> 1125.)</p>
</div>

<p><i>The Sword.</i>&mdash;Remembering that the
Normans were essentially a Scandinavian
nation, we might fairly expect to discover
traces of their origin in the sword
of the period, and this we find to be
the case. It was still straight, long, and
double-edged, slightly tapering towards
the acute-angled point. The quillons
were straight at the time of the Conquest,
but became bent in a small degree
towards the close of the period; the grip
was without swell, and a spherical knob
formed the pommel. The scabbard was
suspended upon the left side by a small
cord round the waist, but occasionally
was supported by the hauberk by being
passed through a hole in the garment,
which thus concealed a portion of it.
See <a href="#fig84">Fig. 84</a>, which dates from <i>c.</i> 1125,
and exhibits this peculiarity.</p>

<p><i>The Bow.</i>&mdash;At the battle of Hastings
the Normans appear to have been extremely
well provided with bowmen, in contradistinction
to the Saxons. The Conqueror is said to have reproached
the latter for this omission, but archers appear in the ranks
of the Saxons on the Bayeux Tapestry, grouped in small
numbers among the axemen, and arrow-heads of iron are
occasionally found in Saxon graves. It would appear t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>hat
all the Norman foot soldiers carried bows, and we know
that the rain of arrows from the sky had a marked effect
upon the fortunes of the day at Hastings. The bow was
of very simple construction at that time, and the quivers
were without covers, and at times slung upon the back,
so that the arrows are seen over the right shoulder.</p>

<p><i>The Mace.</i>&mdash;At Hastings the Saxons appear to have
used the stone hammer and the Normans a mace having
the head heart-shaped; they had recourse to this after the
lance had been splintered. The axe is not seen in the hands
of the Normans, though it subsequently came into high
favour with them, but many of the Saxons wield the weapon
which, from its handle being four or five feet in length, may
justly be termed the pole-axe.</p>

</div>

<p>The body armour of this period is of great interest by
reason of its complexity and variety. Upon the Bayeux
Tapestry there are delineated seven different kinds, which
are reproduced in <a href="#fig85">Fig. 85</a>. No. 1 is undoubtedly the
ringed byrnie which we have noted during the Saxon
period, and No. 2 is either intended to represent interlinked
chain mail or, what is more probable, scale armour,
as it is invariably represented with the points of the
scales downwards. These scales were of various materials,
such as iron, bronze, leather, cuir-bouilli, and horn. Cuir-bouilli
was leather softened by boiling (generally in oil),
and stamped or moulded into a definite form when in
that condition; upon drying it became intensely hard and
tough. It was a favourite agent for defence for centuries,
and did not eventually disappear in England as such
until the close of the fourteenth century. Nos. 3 and 4
may possibly be composed of iron rings or discs of meta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>l
lying upon leather or padded material, with strips of
leather sewn on between the rings. Some authorities
profess to discover jazeraint work in this representation,
which was a method of defence much used in later centuries
for archers’ jacques and various other garments,
but we have no right to assume that the Normans at
that period carried such a heavy weight of armour as
this would necessitate, or were acquainted with such a
technical and complicated manufacture as jazeraint work
implies. The circles, moreover, are too large to represent
studs. Nos. 5 and 6 are the ordinary markings used for
the Gambeson (or Wambeys), the plain quilted defence
which is perhaps the most ancient of all armours and was
known to the early Egyptians. It was padded with a
soft material such as wool, or tow, or cloth reduced to
shreds, which was enclosed between two layers of material
and then sewn together. Although offering but little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
opposition to a lance-thrust it was highly efficacious in
warding off a sword-cut, or stopping arrows when not
delivered at short range. Against the mace, or a stone
from a sling, it was of little use in preventing bones from
being broken. This defence, with various styles of quilting
and varieties of stuffing materials, was in use for
many centuries in England as an under garment, to prevent
the chafing of chain mail and plate, besides affording
additional protection, while among the rank and file of
our English armies it was often the only defence worn.
In MSS. it is shown in different tints, invariably self-colours,
but occasionally in stripes, chequers, &amp;c., and
this serves to prove, if proof were needed, that the surface
exposed to view was not metal but material. No. 7 is
a crude representation of the ordinary conical helmet,
furnished with a nasal, to which is attached a coif or
camail of quilted material, defending the back and sides
of the head and falling upon the shoulders. As a rule,
this quilting was continued over the head, and protected
the wearer from the chafing of the helmet, while at the
same time it distributed its weight. At times, however,
this method was not in use, but a separate covering of
soft or padded material was adopted; in <a href="#fig86">Fig. 86</a> it is
represented cut into the shape of a coif and tied under
the chin. No. 8 is an example of different markings
upon the same dress which is very common in MSS.; it
is invariably introduced in those places where additional
defence was required or desirable, and probably consisted
of metal reinforcing the under garment.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 87.&mdash;Methods of representing different kinds of defences, other than plate.</p>
</div>

<p>It may not be out of place to deal at this point with
various armours, quite apart from plate, which will b<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>e
referred to or illustrated in this work. Hewitt has dealt
with this subject perhaps more
fully and lucidly than any other
author, and the woodcut on
opposite page (<a href="#fig87">Fig. 87</a>) is
taken from his work. No. 1
is perhaps the commonest of
all, and will be referred to as
“banded mail.” Its construction
is fully dealt with in
<a href="#CHAPTER_VII">Chapter VII</a>. Occasionally the
lines between the alternate
crescents are shown double,
but probably that is only a
modification of this style of
defence. During the thirteenth
and fourteenth centuries it was
in constant use, and did not
altogether die out for some
considerable time afterwards.
It is interesting to compare
the variations in this style
either of the actual defence
or of the modes of delineation
by the artists; the brasses of
Bacon, Creke, d’Aubernoun, Northwode, Raven, Cheyne,
&amp;c., may be cited as examples worthy of interest in this
respect, though many more may be found upon careful
inspection. No. 2 is very common in illuminated MSS.,
and is occasionally found chiselled upon effigies; the
Trumpington brass is an example of its incision in met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>al.
No. 3 is generally found exemplified in brasses and effigies
of the thirteenth to the fifteenth centuries, and is by
far the finest method for representing interlinked chain
armour. It has a richness and reality which is unsurpassed
by any other method. On the brass of Sir
Thomas Burton it is shown in perpendicular chains;
horizontal on that of Sir William Bagot; large rings
are engraved in the case of Sir John Hanley, and there
are many examples of small rings. On the brass of Sir
Robert Russell there is a remarkable width between th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>e
parallel rows of chains, from which it may be inferred
that although the chain-mail proper linked laterally,
and also above and below, occasionally parallel chains
linked at the sides only were in vogue. It is probable
that the mail shown on the d’Aubernoun brass is of
the latter pattern. No. 4: early examples of this are to
be found on the Septvans and Buslingthorpe brasses.
No. 5 is taken from one of the Temple Church effigies;
a modification of this method, in which the lines are
straight, may be seen upon an incised figure of a knight
at Avenbury, Herefordshire, <i>c.</i> 1260. No. 6 occurs upon
foreign effigies. No. 7 is an example of the mail shown
upon the monumental statue of Sir William Arden, in
Aston Church, Warwickshire. No. 8 is from early woodcuts.
Nos. 9 and 10 are probably intended to represent
banded mail, and No. 11 appears upon an ivory chessman
of the thirteenth century. No. 12: this has been
mentioned as occurring in the Bayeux Tapestry, and there
are many other instances of its use. No. 13 occurs upon
the Great Seal of King Stephen and other examples of early
seals. No. 14, a variety of No. 12. No. 15, from a steel
statuette; the indentations appear to have been made with
a punch. No. 16 is from an effigy in Bristol Cathedral.
No. 17, from Roy. MS. 14, E. IV., a manuscript written
and illuminated for King Edward IV. No. 18 is much
used upon seals&mdash;one of King Stephen, for example. Nos.
19 and 20, from Add. MSS. 15295 and 15297. No. 21,
from two MSS. of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries
(Egerton MS. 809; Add. MS. 15268). No. 22, from Harl.
MS. 2803.</p>

<p>Under the gambeson or the hauberk or both was worn
a tunic reaching nearly to the knees, and as a rule a little
longer than the defensive garments. It is well shown in
the accompanying figure (<a href="#fig88">Fig.

<p><i>The Hauberk.</i>&mdash;The hauberk
was to the Norman what
the byrnie was to the Saxon,
the chief method of bodily
defence. The coif for the
head was generally a part of
it, with only a small opening
for the face, but at times it
is shown made in two pieces,
the lower extending upwards
to the neck and the coif falling
over it. This was doubtless
to afford better means
of adjustment for the gorget,
plastron-de-fer, or other reinforcement
which was undoubtedly
worn under it upon
the breast. The lower part
of the garment was generally
made to open up the front in order to afford convenience
in riding, but occasionally examples are met with where
openings are made upon both sides. For foot soldiers
no opening was, as a rule, necessary. In some cases the
reinforcement for the breast appears upon the outside o<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>f

<p>Towards the end of the eleventh century
the different distinct styles of armour became
more numerous, and do not present
such uniformity as at the time of the
Conquest. Hefner gives an illustration of
tegulated armour (<a href="#fig90">Fig. 90</a>) from a painting
on vellum dating from <i>c.</i> 1090, when
this system appears to have been introduced.
In the original the plates are silvered, and some
bosses on pendant
scales of a figure
shown upon the right
are gilded. The
square or oblong scales
are shown as overlapping
like slates
upon a roof, and being
probably sewn
upon leather would
afford a good protection
to the wearer.
Two soldiers also in
the same group have
chausses of mail of
the same description,
and the coif is continuous with the body portions of the
hauberk.</p>

<p><i>Chausses</i> of mail of various patterns apparently came
into general use about the commencement of the twelfth
century. They are mentioned above, and apparently in the
figure referred to (No. 90) are continuous scale work round
the limbs; in other examples
they partake of the character of
half-leggings protecting only the
knees and shins of the wearer
(<a href="#fig86">Fig. 86</a>). An excellent example
of this (<a href="#fig92">Fig. 92</a>) is afforded by
a small representation in an
illuminated manuscript Bible
of the date 1148, where, in a
capital letter F, the figures of
David and Goliath are introduced,
the giant lying prone
upon the central projection of
the letter with a stone in his
forehead and the neck of the
hauberk partly cut through.
This is beautifully illustrated
in Shaw’s “Dresses and Decorations.”
The hauberk is
shown continuous with the
coif; the legs are protected
by chausses of some pliable material, thickly covered with
protective studs. These evidently fasten down the back,
and are drawn over the feet by bands or straps meeting
underneath. Later still, in a MS. written about 1170
(<a href="#fig93">Fig. 93</a>), we have an example of Goliath wearing
chausses consisting of a thin material which creases near
the calf, and only a single row of the protective studs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
down the shin. The short boot is analogous with those
worn in <a href="#fig88">Fig. 88</a>, though here defended, or ornamented,
with a few studs.</p>

<p><i>The Norman Shield.</i>&mdash;The shield generally adopted
by the Norman cavalry was kite-shaped and probably
of Sicilian origin; it was either flat, or round so as to
encircle the body to some
extent. The protection
afforded by such a shield is
obvious, inasmuch as it
guarded the upper part of
the body where it was the
broadest, and by tapering
downwards defended the left
leg. It was invariably made
of wood and covered on
both sides with leather, in
addition to which extra defences
of metal were added.
Shields of this description
are referred to which intimate that the whole of the
exterior was of polished metal, though they seem to be
exceptional. On the great seal of Alexander I., King of
Scotland (<a href="#fig94">Fig. 94</a>), the rivet heads are shown upon the
reverse of the shield, which fastened the plates in position.
It was held in the left hand by a bar or strap near the
inside upper portion as shown in the figure. The length
varied, but may be taken as approximately four feet in
height with a maximum width of two feet. The shield
for foot soldiers was somewhat small, as may be seen in
<a href="#fig88">Fig. 88</a>. At the time of the Conquest flat shields were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
frequently used, but all were eventually bowed. The umbo
occasionally appears in illuminated MSS., but its use was
exceptional. In nearly every case a guige, which is very
plainly shown in many of the engravings, is provided for
suspending the shield round the
neck. The round shield (<a href="#fig95">Fig. 95</a>)
is of much rarer occurrence. It
is shown in Harl. MS. 603 and
other MSS. of the close of the
eleventh century, and was very
probably confined entirely to foot
soldiers.</p>

</div>

<p><i>The Helmet.</i>&mdash;The characteristic
defence for the head at
this period is the conical helmet
fitted with a nasal, thus distinguishing
it from the Saxon type,
which did not possess this extra
defence for the face until a few
years previous to the Conquest,
when Norman influence began
to prevail in England. In the
Bayeux Tapestry the nasal is
shown upon practically all the Norman helmets, which
are invariably conical and not very high; they were secured
to the head by straps under the chin, and at times by laces
to the body armour. The nasal continued in use until
about 1140, when it was generally discarded, but isolated
examples may be found in every succeeding century down
to the seventeenth. It was fixed or movable, and that
worn by the Conqueror at Hastings was of the latter d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>escription,
as he removed it to reassure his force by a sight
of his features when a report spread that he had been
slain.</p>

<p>A neck defence was at times fitted to the helmet, which
reached to the ears on either side and depended to the
shoulders: it is shown in <a href="#fig85">Fig. 85</a>, No. 7. Cheek-guards
also were in use.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that the Phrygian-shaped
helmet affected by the Saxons became obsolete in the
Norman period; on the contrary it is frequently represented
in MSS. (<i>cf.</i> Harl. MS. 603, eleventh century;
Harl. MS. 2800, twelfth century, &amp;c.).</p>

<p>During the period under discussion (1066-1180) various
additional weapons were introduced which the exigencies
of warfare appeared to necessitate. Foremost among
these was the military pick called variously the Bisacuta,
Oucin, and Besague, designed to perforate the joints
between the metal plates of the hauberk. It is shown
in <a href="#fig109">Fig. 109</a>, furnished with one point only, though
it commonly had two, as might be inferred from the name
Bisacuta. It was a modification of the martel-de-fer.
A dagger for the use of foot soldiers was also in use, adapted
for rushing upon and disabling knights who had been
unhorsed in a cavalry charge; it was termed the Cultellus,
and appears to have attained occasionally the dimensions
of a short sword. One of the most ancient of weapons
is the Guisarme, which, in its earliest forms, is conjectured
to have been a combination of the scythe and the prong.
The advantage of having a weapon with a cutting edge
and also adapted for thrusting, while at the same time
serving to ward off a blow by entangling another weapo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>n
in the angle formed by the junction of the two, would
appeal very strongly to the foot soldier, by whom it was
chiefly used. The term “bisarme,” by which it was
occasionally known, would indicate the dual nature of the
weapon, which consisted essentially, in all its multitudinous
variations, of a cutting glaive with a rising spike
at the back. It was always fixed to a staff six or more
feet in length, and at times the knife edge partook more
of the nature of an ornamental axe than of the glaive.
Frequent mention of “grinding of the guisarmes” occurs
in ancient writers, from which we infer that the cutting
edge was one of its valuable characteristics, while references
to the “deadly” or “destructive” guisarme are very
common. Some appear to have had small bells attached
to their extremities to frighten the horses of the cavalry.
So common was the weapon that in Scotland it became
one of the recognised means of offence with which the
foot soldier was required to be provided.</p>

<p>The bipennis, or double axe, was still in use, but only
by the Saxon element; the complete fusion of the conquerors
and the conquered led to its gradual extinction
as a national weapon.</p>

<h3>THE CHAIN MAIL PERIOD, 1180-1250</h3>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 96.</p>
</div>

<p>The essential differences between this period and the last
are: (1) the substitution of chain mail for the jazeraint,
mascled, and scale armour which had formerly been used;
(2) the adoption of the pot-helm or heaume as a secondary
defence for the head in place of the conical helmet, the
coif-de-mailles, or the pot-de-fer under the mail; (3) the
introduction of the sleeveless surcoat and the crest.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 100px;">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 97.&mdash;Painted “Pot
Helmet,” <i>c.</i> 1241.</p>
</div>

<p><i>The Heaume.</i>&mdash;The term “heaume” may perhaps by
some be deemed to be hardly applicable to the head-defence
when first introduced, inasmuch as it was small in size,
fitted closely to the head, and was in most respects a helmet.
But inasmuch as a second defence was worn underneath
it from its very inception, the word “heaume” is an appropriate
designation, as it infers a reinforcement to an existing
protection in the next few centuries during which it is
constantly in evidence. It may readily be divided into
two distinct classes, namely, those in which the plates composing
it are riveted together so as to form one piece, and
secondly, those in which a movable ventail can be affixed.
Further subdivisions may be made if desired, such as flat-topped,
round-topped, and sugar-loaf. The word “heaume”
or helm among the northern nations simply meant a covering
of any kind for the head, and we have an example in the
Anglo-Saxon wærhelm, of which examples have been given
in this work. Of the first heaumes the flat-topped, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
those with slightly curved crowns, were probably the earliest,
of which the woodcut No. 96 furnishes an example.</p>

<p>A helm which is preserved in the Musée d’Artillerie
in Paris probably exemplifies the transition between the
Norman helmet and the barrel heaume.
The conical Norman crown is preserved,
but instead of the pendent neck and cheek
guards and nasal, the head and face are
entirely covered by a cylinder of iron,
which is complete but for a vertical slit
covered by a projecting nasal and two
transverse occularia, one on either side.
In England very early examples may be seen upon the
monumental effigy of Hugh Fitz Eudo, in Kirkstead
Chapel, Lincolnshire, and in a slightly modified form in
the carvings of the Presbytery arcade of
Worcester Cathedral, also in the groups
of the Painted Chamber, Westminster.
Holes for breathing purposes are entirely
absent, the sole openings being a pair of
horizontal occularia separated by a perpendicular
band. In this class may be included
the painted pot-heaume on a parchment
MS. dating approximately from
the year 1241, which is shown coloured in green and white
diagonal stripes, and is now in the town library of Leipzic
(<a href="#fig97">Fig. 97</a>). This flat-topped variety appears to have
been viewed with much favour, for we have many examples
of it in this period and in that immediately following. For
instance, the seal of Roger de Bigod, Earl of Norfolk (1231 to
1240) (<a href="#fig98">Fig. 98</a>), exhibits a heaume which is flat-topped,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
furnished with two occularia, and nine small square breathing
holes on either side, strengthened with cross pieces of
iron. The seal of Richard de Clare, Earl of Gloucester
and Hertford, who died in 1262 (<a href="#fig99">Fig. 99</a>), shows a flat
topped helmet of cylindrical fashion, in which the occularium
is formed by one ornamental wavy slit of which the
lower edge is slightly cusped. The helmet of Hamelin,
Earl of Surrey and Warenne, 1202 (<a href="#fig100">Fig. 100</a>), is of the
round-topped variety, and is remarkable for the narrow
occularium and the complete absence of any breathing
holes. It is taken from the Cott. MS., Julius, C. VII.</p>

in use to reinforce the numerous openings in the fore part.
The peculiarity of the surcoat covering the neck should be
noticed, as it is uncommon at this period. From the examples
given it will be apparent that from the year 1180 to
1250, the era under discussion, no heaume is represe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>nted
with a movable visor, and this may be taken as a distinguishing
feature, inasmuch as they appear shortly
afterwards.</p>

<p>Whatever doubts may exist respecting the presence
of true chain mail in the early Norman period in conjunction
with mascled, scale, leather, horn, and jazeraint work
generally, no misconception can arise with respect to the
epoch under consideration, where, together with the
heaume and the plastron-de-fer, it formed the sole defence
of the knight. Chain mail has existed from very remote
antiquity, but owing to its nature is of such a perishable
quality, exposing the maximum of surface to atmospheric
oxidation, that practically no examples have come down
to us of all the vast quantity fabricated in remote ages.
There are in the British Museum some aggregations of
iron rust brought from the excavations at Nineveh, which
experts assert have once been hauberks of chain mail of
the true pattern (so far as interlocking is concerned),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> and
hence are credited with being the earliest examples in
existence. That the Romans used rings, together with
discs and plates, as defensive covering, backed by a substratum
of a tough textile fabric, is well known; but
whether these rings were so interlinked as to form a true
chain mail has been much questioned. Discoveries have,
however, been made from time to time which tend to
prove that they were not unacquainted with it, and taking
into consideration the extent of territory they possessed,
and the number of nations owning their sway, it would
be a matter for wonder if they were ignorant of its
existence. Sculptures may be referred to which appear
to indicate true chain mail, but so many conventional
styles and methods were used by artists to indicate
defensive equipment, that it is difficult to arrive at a
definite settlement of the question. That this means of
protection originated in the East is undoubted, where its
coolness would be a great advantage; that it spread in
some mysterious way to the Teutonic nations of the
West is also certain, and we must look for its introduction
there to an age long prior to the time of the
Crusades. It was imitated, however, by the unskilful
western artificers in such a manner that immense weight
occurred and became an inseparable condition, and in
this manner during the early Crusades it came into
contact with the light chain mail, characteristic of
Oriental workmanship, covering the nomadic cavalry of
the East. These horsemen were enabled in consequence
to move with a swiftness and freedom quite impossible to
the crusading knights, thus being forcibly reminiscent of
the ponderous Spanish galleons of the Armada, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
small but handy English vessels. In the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries the cost of true chain mail was prohibitory
to all but the very wealthy, in spite of great
quantities which fell to the lot of the victors in Palestine.
The manufacture varies under the conditions of time, place,
and requirements. Wire, or
what answered for wire, was
made in the earlier periods of
a very rough character, in
the manufacture of which the
hammer evidently played an
important part; but later on,
when the art of wire-drawing
became known, the cross
section of a link exhibits as
perfect a circle as it would
if of modern construction.
This wire was wound tightly
round an iron core of convenient
size, cut off in rings,
and each ring separately
treated by flattening the overlapping ends, piercing them
with a steel punch, and inserting a small rivet. This rivet
was either hammered to flatten it, or it was finished off
in a vice. The general method in almost every coat of
mail was for one ring to interlink with four others; a few
variations occur, however, such as rows of rings occasionally
interlinking with other rows above and below, the use of
alternate double rings, &amp;c. From the foregoing it will
readily be seen that the cost of production of chain mail in
labour alone must have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
excessive. The strengthening
of the mail by insertion
of leather straps was occasionally
done, the straps being
carried through the links in
horizontal rows, while vertical
rows of strapping in
addition to the foregoing are
not unknown. In the metalwork,
also, the resistance of
mail could be considerably
augmented by enlarging the
rivet joinings. Considering
the intricate nature of mail,
it is no matter for wonderment
that neither in the
centuries under consideration
nor in those immediately
following do we find the
common soldier clad in true
chain mail, as every portion,
large or small, would be
carefully retained by the
knightly wearer. The incised
slab of Sir John de
Bitton, in Bitton Church,
Somersetshire, 1227 (<a href="#fig103">Fig.
103</a>), may be taken as an
excellent example of this
early period preserved in a
monumental effigy: the larg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>e shield covering the greater
part of the body has no guige, and is necessarily quite
flat, though doubtless convex in reality. The coif-demailles
is separate from the hauberk, and has a lappet
overlying the upper part of the gorget to protect the
junction there. The length of the hauberk can only be
surmised, inasmuch as the lower border is not shown,
but from other examples we glean that it reached nearly
to the knees. The mail gloves are
also distinct from the hauberk, and
bands, laces, or straps are used to
protect the junctions with the
sleeves: separate fingers are not
shown, but the gloves are precisely
similar to the mitten gauntlets of
the end of the century. The
chausses are of chain mail, and
continuous with the covering for
the feet. The heaume is not
shown; it is probable that the
flattish configuration of the upper part of the head indicates
that a pot-de-fer of some kind was worn under the
coif, as in <a href="#fig104">Fig. 104</a>. The sword is long and broad, the
hilt having short, straight quillons and a cylindrical grip,
terminating in a circular pommel. The spurs are of the
short pryck form. It should be noticed that the artist has
drawn the figure too large for the slab, and has consequently
been compelled to encroach upon the bevelled edges.</p>

</div>

<p><i>The Surcoat</i> is of the sleeveless variety, one of
the distinguishing features of this period, and reaches
nearly to the heels, being, as usual, split up in front and
probably also behind, for convenience in riding. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
introduced in order to guard the mail from rain, and
indirectly as some protection against the heat of the
sun’s rays; but the chief reason for its adoption was that
it afforded a means for recognising the wearer, whose
features were now completely hidden by the heaume, thus
rendering it impossible in the hurly-burly of battle to
know friend from foe. Previous to this the nasal helmet,
although covering but part of the features, had at times
led to confusion, even as early as the battle of Hastings
as previously stated. Thus heraldry, which up to this time
had only been in an incipient condition, suddenly found
itself of the highest importance, and developed in the
course of succeeding centuries into a science, the study of
which was deemed absolutely necessary for all pretending
to the possession of gentle blood. The surcoat had its
inception in the long, flowing tunic which during the last
period dealt with had been worn underneath the hauberk,
as shown upon the two great seals of King Richard I.,
and the suggestion would be natural to transfer the latter
to the outermost position, leaving to the padded gambeson
alone the duty of supporting the weight of the hauberk.
The first English monarch to appear in this military attire
as an outer garment was King John, and he is shown
thus habited upon his great seal: while his rival, the
Dauphin Louis, who proved such an unwelcome visitor
in the latter part of his reign, is similarly represented
upon the French seal, as may be seen in the Harl. MS.
43, B. VII., date 1216, to which it is appended. To the
Cott. MS., XIX. 2, the seal of Alexander II. of Scotland,
1214-1249, is attached, and this also shows the
surcoat. It was of white material or self-colou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>red, sometimes
diapered, and generally bore heraldic charges. The
length varied, and both long
and short surcoats are seen of
approximately the same date;
the former reaching at times
to the heels and the latter
to the hem of the hauberk.
The material varied with the
means and taste of the wearer;
the better descriptions were of
silk, richly embroidered with
gold and sometimes decorated
with precious stones, cloth of
gold of the richest quality being
also used.</p>

</div>

<p><i>The Crest.</i>&mdash;Although much
uncertainty exists among exponents
of the art of heraldry
upon the origin of the crest,
yet a little investigation leads
to the conclusion that it need
not be a matter of speculation
or conjecture. The first example
of the nature of a
crest appears upon the cap of
Geoffrey, Count of Anjou, died
1150; his monumental slab in
the museum at Le Mans, which
stood formerly in the cathedral there, exhibits the figure of
a lion (<a href="#fig105">Fig. 105</a>). The helmet of Philip d’Alsace, Count of
Flanders (<i>c.</i> 1181), shows a lion painted upon the s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>ide of the
same character as another appearing upon his shield; but
what is generally acknowledged to be the earliest authenticated
example of a crest fulfilling all the desired conditions
is that of Richard the Lion Heart, who upon his great seal
shows a fan-shaped ornament surmounting the heaume,
and upon the base is painted a lion passant (<a href="#fig106">Fig. 106</a>).
One of the earliest instances of the use of a crest on
the Continent is that afforded by a MS. in the Royal
Library at Berlin, and belonging to the end of the
twelfth century (<a href="#fig107">Fig. 107</a>). In this case an actual figure,
that of a red lion, appears, and not paintings, as in the
two examples previously cited. It is possible that the
adoption of a crest upon the helmet may have been partly
of a defensive character, for the effect of a sword-cut
would be very materially modified after passing through
a stiff erection of steel plate or of tough cuir-bouilli, while
against the mace and the pole-axe it would also afford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
some slight protection. In support of this conjecture it
may be noticed that crests at first were ridged and serrated,
somewhat after the style which distinguished the pike-guards
of the fifteenth century in their embryonic stage, as if purposely
designed to arrest the edge of a weapon. The many
examples which occur in an undecorated form preclude the
thought that they were invented in order to bear heraldic
cognisances, although they were quickly seized upon to
fulfil the duty hitherto borne by the shield and surcoat,
namely, to afford means of identifying the wearer. Of
course the fan-shaped ornament under consideration may
have simply been the outcome of that instinct for personal
adornment and decoration which appears to be inherent in
the human race, and which manifested itself in the mediæval
period much more than now; but when it is considered that
many of these fans are carried forward well over the face
and at the same time far backwards, the conclusion is almost
compelled that they originated in an endeavour to secure
more protection for the top of the head than the crown of
the heaume afforded. The great crests of a subsequent
period were never used in actual combat, but were reserved
exclusively for tournament purposes.</p>

<p><i>The Shield</i> during this period was cut off as a rule in a
straight line at the top, and was convex, so as to partially
enclose the figure (see <a href="#fig108">Fig. 108</a>). It gradually decreased
in size, until towards the close it became the small, well-known
“heater-shaped” shield which remained in vogue
for such a lengthy period. It was invariably decorated with
the armorial bearings of the wearer, which in the early part
of the chain mail period were mostly fanciful or devotional
and of a transitory character, but became hereditary as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
progressed. The only weapon of importance introduced was
the arbalest, which will be dealt with in the next period.</p>

<p>The equipment of the ordinary rank and file of the chain
mail period did not vary in any essential features from that
which preceded it. In <a href="#fig88">Fig. 88</a> we
have two foot soldiers from Harl.
MS. Y6, one of whom wears the
Norman helmet, now truncated,
with a nasal, which apparently is
very long and wide. A similar
helmet, but minus the nasal, defends
his companion. The usual
hauberk of chain mail or a cheaper
substitute covers the body, and the
legs are undefended. The mode
of wearing the stockings and the
cross bar below the leaf-shaped
head of one spear tends to the belief that the illuminator
was of Saxon blood or depicting others of that descent.
The shields are suspended by guiges in both cases, and
the fanciful decorations illustrate the assertions previously
made in this chapter. In woodcut No. 109 a very
characteristic group of soldiery of about the year 1220
is shown, taken from Harl. MS. 4751. The heavily-armed
arbalestier in pot-helm and mail is one of a force
defending a castle, and has discharged a quarrel which
transfixes an archer of the attacking party. Before him,
and apparently without any defensive equipment other
than a chapelle-de-fer, is a foot soldier with a military
pick in his right hand and a sword of short dimensions
in the left. An arbalestier is probably shown in the t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>hird
position from the front, and an archer fourth, while the
fifth is unmistakably a slinger. As was generally the rule,
no protective covering was allowed the slingers&mdash;the one
in question has not even a hat&mdash;who from the nature of
their weapon were perforce compelled to be always in open
order when in action and at a distance from the enemy, and
presumably suffered less than the closely-packed bodies of
men-at-arms, billmen, and even archers. His sling appears
to be in no way different to the Saxon weapon shown in
<a href="#fig70">Fig. 70</a>. The last man is clad in a coif and hauberk of mail,
and is armed with an axe. At this period a weapon appears
in the illuminated MSS. which is apparently of recent introduction,
namely the Staff Sling or Fustibal. It is
generally shown in besieging operations pitted against the
defenders on the walls, or in naval warfare as in <a href="#fig110">Fig. 110</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>.
The action of the sling is readily seen, the loop at the end
allowing the bag to disengage itself automatically at the
psychological moment, and to discharge the stone. In
this case it seems to be
charged with some combustible
material to be
hurled on board an opposing
ship. The slinger is
as usual bareheaded and
devoid of bodily defences.
With him is an archer also
discharging combustibles
affixed to the end of an
arrow. He is habited
in a sleeveless leather
hauberk strengthened
with round plates, presumably of metal; a coif of mail or
leather covers his head. The third figure carries a sword,
spear, and pole-axe, possibly his own, and also the close-quarter
weapons of the projectile throwers.</p>

<p>The equipment of a man-at-arms at the close of this
period is well shown in <a href="#fig111">Fig. 111</a>, from Auct. D. 4, 17,
in the Bodleian Library. It dates from about 1250, and
illustrates the defensive properties of leather in combination
with iron. The steel chapelle-de-fer covers a chain mail
coif which may be part of a continuous hauberk, as the arms
and hands are covered with mail of the same description.
Bands of leather round the throat afford the protection of
a gorget: they are affixed to a hauberk composed of leather
scales of large size and leaf-like shape showing the midrib,
while a belt round the waist and pendent leaves on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
skirt complete a most effective means of bodily defence.
The legs are enclosed in soft leather chausses protected by
metal studs, upon which is a cross-gartering of leather thongs.
The only weapon shown is an axe of formidable proportions.
A spearman of <i>c.</i> 1280 is shown in Add. MS.,
11639, representing Goliath of Gath, in which a chapelle-de-fer
is a feature (<a href="#fig112">Fig. 112</a>).</p>

<h3>CHAIN MAIL REINFORCED, 1250-1325</h3>


<p>The special points which distinguish this period are:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The introduction of Banded Mail.</p>

<p>2. The use of Ailettes.</p>

<p>3. The invention of the Conical Heaume borne by the shoulders.</p>

<p>4. The reinforcement of the Chain Mail by Plate.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 113.&mdash;Sir John d’Aubernoun, 1277.
Stoke d’Aubernoun Church, Guildford,
Surrey.</p>
</div>

<p>One of the most remarkable brasses in existence is that
of Sir John d’Aubernoun, in Stoke d’Aubernoun Church,
near Guildford, Surrey (<a href="#fig113">Fig. 113</a>). It is the earliest
known example of this form of monumental effigy either in
the British Isles or on the Continent, and dates from about
the year 1277, the fifth of Edward I. It is to be noted
that it is unique among the brasses of this reign by reason
of the knight being represented with straight lower limbs,
the remainder all having the cross-legged position.
Although the figure is somewhat disproportionate, and the
partial covering up of the lower parts of the legs by the
surcoat is unfortunate, yet as a work of art, and especially
as an example of technique and patience on the part of the
engraver, it is unrivalled. Every separate link of the mail is
faithfully represented. The reinforcement of the chain mail
by secondary defences is here exemplified in its primitive
stage, a pair of genouillières<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
only appearing, which from
their ornamental appearance
are presumably of cuir-bouilli,
or of plate covered with cuir-bouilli.
The reason for the
introduction of this defence
was not alone the protection
afforded: the intolerable drag
of chain mail upon the knee
or elbow when flexed prevented
freedom of action in
either joint; but by the termination
of the mail at the
upper part of the genouillière
to which it was affixed, and
the continuation of it below,
an advantage was gained which
was fully appreciated. The
coif-de-mailles upon the head
descends to the shoulders on
either side and covers part of
the surcoat, while the hauberk
has sleeves which are prolonged
to cover the hand with
mail gauntlets, not divided
for the fingers. The mail
chausses are continued like
the sleeves of the hauberk, in
order to protect the feet as
well as the legs. Over the
mail appears a loose surcoat
reaching to below the knees
and confined at the waist by a
cord, from below which it open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>s in front and falls on either
side in many folds, being also divided at the back to
facilitate riding. It does not bear any ornament or design,
but apparently is of rich material, and has a fringed border.
The sword is long and straight, with short quillons drooping
towards the blade; the grip is slightly swelling, and the
circular pommel is enriched with a design. The method of
suspending the sword is peculiar to the period: it grips the
scabbard in two places, between which a small strap runs as
a guide; the weapon thus hangs diagonally across the left
front of the figure. The guige bearing the shield is enriched
with roses alternating with the mystical cross (signifying
good fortune and long life) termed the Fylfot, Gammadion,
or Svastika, in which each arm of a Greek cross is continued
at right angles; it passes over the right shoulder, and
supports a small, flat, heater-shaped shield, upon which the
arms appear (<i>azure</i>, a chevron, <i>or</i>). The spurs are the usual
short ones of the pryck variety affixed by ornamental straps.
The lance passes under the right arm, and displays a small
fringed pennon charged with the same armorial insignia as
the shield; it is shortened to permit of its introduction, and
shows no grip for the hand. This is the only example of a
brass in which the lance is introduced.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 114.&mdash;Sir Roger de Trumpington,

Church, Cambridge.</p>
</div>

<p>Another celebrated brass exemplifying in a remarkable
degree the military equipment of the period is that of Sir
Roger de Trumpington, 1289, in Trumpington Church, near
Cambridge (<a href="#fig114">Fig. 114</a>). This well-known monumental effigy
is one of five brasses which portray knights in the cross-legged
attitude, concerning which so much has been said
and so much written. The popular idea is, that the cross-legged
position denotes a pilgrimage, or else a participation
in a Crusade, on the part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
deceased, but this supposition is
entirely negatived by the existence
of monuments to <i>bonâ-fide</i>
Crusaders, and to persons known
to have visited the Holy Land,
who are represented with the
lower limbs not crossed. It is
to be noted that this position
is entirely confined to England
with the exception of one at
Dublin, and the generally accepted
ideas are that these persons so
represented were benefactors to
the Church and died in the odour
of sanctity. But it is perfectly
admissible to suppose that, after
all, this position was entirely an
idea of the artist or the engraver,
preventing as it did the ungainly
stiffness in the d’Aubernoun brass.
There are two examples of carved
stone effigies both cross-armed and
cross-legged&mdash;Sir Roger de Kerdeston,
1337, at Reepham, and Sir
Oliver d’Ingham, 1343, at Ingham,
Norfolk; but neither of
these were Crusaders, while both
were benefactors to their respective
churches.</p>

<p>The armour shown in the
Trumpington brass is similar in
general outline to the d’Aubern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>oun example, but is
peculiar in manifesting nothing of an ornamental character.
Two or three additions to the equipment, however, are
shown which are important. The head rests upon the great
heaume, which is of large proportions and conical, adapted
for resting upon and being supported by the shoulders. At
the apex is shown a staple for affixing either the contoise or
the heraldic crest (to be alluded to later), and this feature is
also shown upon the heaume of Sir William de Staunton,
1312, at Staunton, Notts (<a href="#fig115">Fig. 115</a>).
From the lower part of the back of the
heaume a chain depends which fastens to
a narrow cord tied tightly round the
waist; by this arrangement the knight
was enabled to regain this most important
part of his equipment in the event of his
being unhelmed. Later on this chain
was affixed to a staple riveted or welded
to the plastron-de-fer, openings being
made in the hauberk and surcoat to
permit of this.</p>

</div>

</div>
<p><i>Ailettes.</i>&mdash;This period might almost be termed the
“ailette period,” but for the fact that this extraordinary
adjunct only prevailed during a portion of the time.
They were small shields or defences fastened at right
angles across the shoulders, designed to lessen the effect
of a sweeping cut from a sword or battle-axe, and were
prototypes of the passe-gardes of the late fifteenth century,
and of the epaulettes of the present day. The fact that
a brass has necessarily a plane surface prevents these
being seen in their proper place; a perspective representation
would afford a vertical line only upon each shoulder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
and in order to display the surfaces and avoid any foreshortening,
the artist has turned them at right angles to
their real positions. The usual mode of their adjustment
may be plainly perceived from a representation of the seal
of Henry de Beaumont, Earl of Buchan, 1322 (<a href="#fig116">Fig. 116</a>),
where the stiff lower portion is bent upwards and downwards
to prevent a lateral fall; at the same time it is
shaped to the shoulder, and probably fixed tightly to the
hauberk, or the coif-de-mailles, by rings or rivets. Another
example from a seal is that of John de Warenne, Earl of
Surrey, 1329 (<a href="#fig117">Fig. 117</a>). Here the ailettes are apparently
fastened only by one of the points and the half of one
of the sides, but undoubtedly the whole of it was concave
to the helmet; if so delineated by the artist the
remote point would have been invisible, and not proper
for heraldic representation as required upon a seal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
Ailettes are rarely shown upon brasses and effigies; possibly
the Buslingthorpe, Chartham, Gorleston, and Clehongre
examples are the only ones in addition to the Trumpington.
Upon seals they occur fairly often, but not with
any frequency until the commencement of the fourteenth
century. An early notice of ailettes occurs in the Roll
of Purchases for the great tournament held at Windsor
in 1278, where they are stated to have been made of
leather covered with a kind of cloth. Silk laces were
supplied to fasten them, and it is remarkable, to say the
least, that the brass of Sir Roger de Trumpington, who
was one of the thirty-eight knights taking part in the
tournament, should furnish one of the earliest and best
examples which has come down to modern times. In
the curious painted window at Tewkesbury representing
Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, who perished upon
the field of Bannockburn in 1314, we have the best illustration
of ailettes contributed by stained glass. Probably
the windows were made not long after the event, judging
from the armour, which would be designed of contemporary
pattern. Hewitt engraves a figure of a knight in
Ash-by-Sandwich Church in which the ailettes appear as
square projections behind the shoulders. In illuminated
MSS. of this period the ailettes are very frequently shown,
and are figured with combatants in all positions, so that
the nature of the defence can be very clearly seen. They
are also shown of all shapes and sizes. A lozenge-shaped
ailette is seen on the accompanying figure (No. 118) from
Roy. MS. 14, E. III., in which the same device appears as
upon the shield, thus proving that it is not a square one
worn awry. At times one ailette only seems to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
been used, and that upon the left side; it appears as a
reinforcement to the shield in an illuminated MS. of Sir
Launcelot (Add. MS. 10,293), date 1316 (<a href="#fig119">Fig. 119</a>).
Sometimes the ailettes are so high and wide that they
almost enclose the great heaume by forming a circle round
it, being fixed behind where they meet, and only allowing a
small opening in front for vision. The proper position is,
as has been stated, upon the shoulders and at right angles
to them, but when enlarged or of an inconvenient shape
they were fixed upon the upper part of the arm or behind
the shoulder. For example, in <a href="#fig120">Fig. 120</a>, which is taken
from a MS. in the Bodleian Library, the ailettes are shown
of a circular form, which obviously would be awkward to
fix upon the shoulder, hence we see them upon the upper
part of the arm.</p>

<p>The use of ailettes is somewhat perplexing, and antiquarians
have held various theories respecting them. That
they were not merely armorial is proved by many showing
no designs upon them whatever; that they were not for
the purpose of distinguishing leaders in a fray is negatived
by the fact that a knight’s cognisance was much better
recognised from his shield, surcoat, and crest; also, the
ailettes appear in tournaments where there would be no
necessity for recognition. The only supposition which
appears to be defensible is that they were shields for the
neck and shoulders, but more especially for the latter, as
the great heaume protected the neck. In Germany they
were called “tartschen,” or shields. The defence afforded
by a thick piece of leather, quilted material, or steel in
that position will be at once appreciated; so low did they
reach at times that they covered the junction of the arm
with the body at the back, and this is well exemplified in
the Clehongre effigy, dating from 1320, in which they are
attached to the shoulders by arming points, and are concave
to the body. Occasionally for tournaments and pageant
purposes ailettes appear to have been made most elaborately;
thus we find in the inventory of Piers Gaveston in
1313 a mention of a pair garnished and fretted with pearls.</p>

</div>

<p>There is a singular figure of a knight in an attitude of
devotion illustrated in Roy. MS. 2, A. XXII., dating from
about 1290, which has been ably reproduced in Shaw’s
“Dresses and Decorations of the Middle Ages” (<a href="#fig121">Fig.
121</a>). Many little details of thirteenth-century armour
are delineated, affording a valuable acquisition to our
knowledge. The mode in which the coif-de-mailles is
fastened up to the side of the head by an arming point
is well shown; the same method has been illustrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
in <a href="#fig122">Fig. 122</a> on p. <a href="#Page_105">107</a>, where two continuous hauberks
are seen looped up in the same way. The palms of the
hands are free from rings, in order to afford a better grasp
of a weapon; this was the usual mode for constructing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
the mail gauntlet, and is also shown in <a href="#fig123">Fig. 123</a>. It
also permitted the gauntlet being slipped off the hand
when required. The gauntlets are continuous with the
sleeves of the hauberk. Upon the shoulders are singularly
small ailettes, consisting merely of a cross similar in design
to those emblazoned upon the surcoat. The thighs are
defended by chaussons or haut-de-chausses of mail,
apparently with rings only upon the parts exposed. The
chausses are of Bezanté armour, formed of small discs,
each with a stud in the centre; these are sewn or riveted
on to a pliable material, probably leather, which is fastened
together by a series of points down the back of the leg.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a><br /><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
The chausses are prolonged to cover the feet, upon which
are strapped the usual short pryck spur. The heaume is
very much ornamented, and its general contour points to
an earlier date than <i>c.</i> 1290, as does also the absence of
genouillières. The lance and
its pennon are shown. A
leg protection of leather and
highly ornamented was in
use upon the Continent at
this period; its form and
dimensions may be gleaned
from <a href="#fig125">Fig. 125</a>.</p>

<p>In a MS. in the Bodleian
Library (No. 211) a knight
or man-at-arms is represented carrying a shield and
wearing ailettes of a circular pattern, which are fastened to
his banded mail at the upper part of the arm (<a href="#fig124">Fig. 124</a>).
He wears a hemispherical steel cap and is clothed in a
voluminous surcoat. A similar example, but of later date,
is shown in Roy. MS. 20, D. 2, British Museum, where a
figure habited in banded mail and a conical pot-helm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
with sword and shield, wears circular
ailettes in precisely the same manner

<h4>THE BANNER, PENNON, AND
PENNONÇEL</h4>

<p>The knightly Banner of the period
was either square or oblong; in the
latter case the height was invariably
twice the width (see <a href="#fig127">Fig. 127</a>). It was
the distinctive mark of the Knight
Banneret, and always indicated superiority
of command and importance, inasmuch
as it required a retinue of at least
fifty men-at-arms with their followers
to adequately support the dignity. Thus it was a
position of distinction which could only be enjoyed
by the rich, and the chronicles of the mediæval period
record instances of knights who, having specially distinguished
themselves on the field of battle, declined the
proffered honour of Knight Banneret on the scor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>e of insufficient
means. If, on the other hand, it were accepted,
it was usual to convert the pennon of the knight into a
banner on the spot by simply cutting off the tail or tails.
The simple knight, or Knight Bachelor as he was termed,
carried a Pennon or Pavon, which was furnished with one
or more tails, as in <a href="#fig121">Fig. 121</a>, where it is represented with
three; that of Henri de Perci, first Earl of Northumberland,
with two (see <a href="#fig128">Fig. 128</a>); and in the d’Aubernoun
brass, where one is depicted. He became eligible for
knighthood at twenty-one, presuming that he had sufficient
private property to support the dignity, but had to
distinguish himself in the field or otherwise before the
honour was conferred. It was not absolutely necessary
to be of gentle birth, as many examples may be cited of
knighthood being conferred upon those who could not
claim such descent. The contingent he led into battle
under his pennon varied in number according to his means.
The Pennonçel or Pensil was a small, narrow streamer
to which the Esquire, or aspirant to knighthood, was
entitled. It was necessary for him to serve an apprenticeship
in arms, and he generally attended the castle of a
neighbouring baron, or the court of the king. Such was,
briefly, the etiquette respecting the three different flags
of knighthood, quite apart from those of the chief commanders
and the great standards. There were, of course,
variations introduced. Pennons shown in Figs. <a href="#fig129">129</a> and <a href="#fig130">130</a>
from the Painted Chamber are triangular, and the banner
in <a href="#fig130">Fig. 130</a> is nearly three times as high as it is wide.
Before quitting this subject it may be mentioned that
knighthood was quite distinct from birth and social position,
and was simply a scheme of military rank, the aspirants havin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>g
absolutely equal opportunities for acquiring the dignity.</p>

<p><i>The Heaume.</i>&mdash;During the first
thirty years of this period, that is until
about 1280, the heaumes continued to
be generally of the flat-topped variety
not reaching to the shoulders, but
having the addition of a movable visor.
One, however, shown in <a href="#fig131">Fig. 131</a> and
dating from <i>c.</i> 1250, differs considerably,
and shows a heaume approaching
the dimensions and shape of a bascinet,
while the visor is adapted for raising
or for removal. An earlier example
without a visor is one seen in a group
from the Painted Chamber in conjunction
with helmets having a nasal
(<a href="#fig130">Fig. 130</a>). In <a href="#fig132">Fig. 132</a> we have an example of one of
the earliest and plainest of this variety,
in which the ventaille could be removed
at pleasure from the two projecting studs
on the heaume which kept it in place.
<a href="#fig133">Fig. 133</a> is of the same type, but furnished
with a more elaborate visor, and
with a crown surmounting it. <a href="#fig134">Fig. 134</a>
is from the seal of Richard Plantagenet,
King of the Romans and Earl of Cornwall,
who died in 1272, and <a href="#fig135">Fig. 135</a> from
that of Robert de Ferrars, Earl of Derby,
died <i>c.</i> 1279; in both we trace the tendency to alter the
shape of the lower rim. The movable ventaille was not
in all cases directly detachable from the heaume, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> swung
outwards upon a hinge on one side, similar to a wicket gate;
as this hinge had a pin running through it which could be
withdrawn, the visor was
wholly removed if not required.</p>

<p>About 1270 the round-topped
variety came into
fashion, of which examples
are found until the end of
the century and even after
it. The seal of Patrick
Dunbar, 10th Earl of March, affords a good illustration of
the heaume with a circular crown; it is furnished with a
movable visor. Other examples are shown in groups in
the Painted Chamber at Westminster, and two very late
specimens are represented in Figs. <a href="#fig116">116</a> and <a href="#fig117">117</a> on p. <a href="#Page_101">102</a>.</p>

<p>About the year 1280 the conical-topped heaume came
into use, whose general form is delineated in <a href="#fig137">Fig. 137</a>, and
has already been noticed in the Trumpington brass. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
of great weight, and either hung at the saddle bow, or was
carried by the squire, when not in
use; it rested upon the shoulders,
and thus relieved the head of the
greater part of its weight. Two
heaumes are here shown (Figs.
<a href="#fig138">138</a>, <a href="#fig139">139</a>) from Add. MS. 10,294
in the British Museum. One is of
the plain and ordinary pattern, but
the second shows a movable visor
which can either be raised or removed
entirely. It also illustrates
a reinforcing plate protecting the
sides of the head. Inside it was
thickly padded, and representations
of this feature may often be discerned upon monumental
effigies, where the heaume is used to support the head
of the recumbent knightly figure. To keep it in position
laces were attached to the lower edge at the back; these
are clearly seen in <a href="#fig121">Fig. 121</a>, p. <a href="#Page_106">106</a>.</p>

<p>The development of the crest during this period did not
make much headway, but a few
examples from seals and MSS.
will show that there was a certain
amount of progress. The heaume
of Baron Henri de Perci, <i>c.</i> 1300
(<a href="#fig140">Fig. 140</a>), exhibits a highly
ornamented crest with the distinctive
feature of two streamers
affixed to its base, the contoise
or mantling in its incipient form.
The comb is deeply serrated,
and ornamented with gadroons
springing from the centre. Upon
the seal of Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, 1301 (<a href="#fig141">Fig. 141</a>),
the conical heaume is shown, not reaching, however, to the
shoulders, with a small, plain comb upon its summit, differing
in that respect from the crests of Richard Fitzalan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Earl of Arundel (<a href="#fig142">Fig. 142</a>), and Humphrey Bohun, Earl
of Hereford (<a href="#fig143">Fig. 143</a>), which both date from the same
year. A singularly plain heaume, considering the distinction
of the wearer, is that of Edward, Prince of Wales,
1305, as delineated upon his seal (<a href="#fig144">Fig. 144</a>). The crest
of John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey, 1329, shown in <a href="#fig117">Fig.
117</a> on p. <a href="#Page_101">102</a>, displays a startling development upon the
preceding examples, and exhibits a high order of decorative
design in crests at this early period.</p>

<p class="caption-sub">Sir Robert de Bures, 1302. Acton
Church, Suffolk</p>

</div>

<p>At Acton in Suffolk is a monumental brass to Sir
Robert de Bures, dating from the year 1302, which holds the
proud position of being the finest early brass in existence,
and which may also fairly claim to be the finest military
brass extant. The details of equipment differ but little
from the d’Aubernoun and Trumpington brasses, but the
guige of the shield, by being partially hidden under <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>the
tippet of the coif-de-mailles, indicates that the coif was
entirely separate from the hauberk, and was not continuous,
as might be imagined from the early brasses. The genouillières
are very elaborate, and probably of cuir-bouilli; above
them and beneath the skirt of the hauberk are seen the
padded and quilted trews covering the chausses from the
knee upwards. This garment, whose surface was usually
of silk, baudekyn, or other costly material, is shown in the
brass to be richly embroidered with fleur-de-lys and an
ornament resembling in shape the Greek lyre, disposed
alternately in lozenges formed by the reticulations of the
silken cords, and a similar decoration appears upon the
grip of the sword (<a href="#plate11">Plate XI.</a>).</p>

<p>Sir Robert de Septvans, 1306, is another knight whose
brass effigy has the cross-legged position; it is in Chartham
Church, Kent, and affords an excellent illustration of
the military accoutrement at the termination of the reign
of Edward I. (<a href="#fig146">Fig. 146</a>). The singular name of Septvans (or
Seven Fans) is derived from the heraldic cognisance of the
family, and is shown upon the figure as seven fans of the
shape used for winnowing wheat at that period. The coif-de-mailles
is thrown back in this effigy, and rests upon the
shoulders in folds; the ailettes are square or oblong, and
the sleeves of the hauberk are thrown back off the hands
and are shown depending from the wrist. Beneath the
hauberk the quilted undergarment called the haqueton
appears; the trews are of similar material, and apparently
are continued under the genouillières, probably to avoid
chafing. The latter are of plate, and a stud is shown which
fastens them to a strap behind the knee. The sword-hilt
and scabbard are enriched with a highly effective diape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>r
design.</p>

Croft, Lincs.</p>
</div>

<p>Between the years 1306 and 1320 there are no brasses
in existence exhibiting the full military equipment of the
time, the example at Croft, 1310, being only a half-brass and
singularly devoid of detail (<a href="#fig145">Fig. 145</a>). Two
brasses, however, dating from 1320, afford
us an opportunity of seeing the marked
development in defences which had been
adopted in the interval. The Bacon brass
in Gorleston Church, Suffolk, has been
much mutilated, but sufficient is retained
to make it of interest. The coif-de-mailles,
hauberk, surcoat, sword-belt, shield, and
guige show no differences, but in the
plate defences a great advance has been made. The back
of the upper arms from shoulder to elbow, and the front of
the lower arms from the bend of the elbow to the wrist,
are protected by plates of steel, fastened by steel straps
round the limbs; these are respectively the Demi-Brassarts
and Demi-Vambraces. Upon the elbows are the Coudières,
and upon the knees Genouillières of plate, while the shins
are defended by Demi-Jambarts, all being fixed over the
chain mail to fulfil the office of reinforcements. At the
shoulder and elbow bends, roundels of plate appear, and
over the shoulder are ailettes marked with the Cross of St.
George. The shield is small and heater-shaped, and is furnished
with a narrow guige. In the Fitzralph brass, 1320,
Pebmarsh Church, Essex (<a href="#fig147">Fig. 147</a>), the general arrangement
is similar to the Gorleston brass, but no ailettes are shown,
and the shield is large and concave to the body. Upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
the feet are Sollerets consisting of five lames of plate
riveted together and kept in place by two straps passing
under each foot. The swords of both figures show straight
quillons not drooping to the blade as formerly. The pryck
spur is still in vogue, and from the roundels the small
projecting spikes should be noticed. The five cross-legged
brasses thus described and illustrated are all that now
remain to us, and of these five only one, that of Trumpington,
so far as is known, represents a knight who followed
the banner of the Holy Cross to Palestine.</p>

<p>The defensive equipment of the ordinary foot soldier of
this period is well delineated in <a href="#fig148">Fig. 148</a>, which is taken
from Add. MS. 17,687 in the British Museum, a German
illumination dating from <i>c.</i> 1290. The subject is the
Massacre of the Innocents, a favourite theme for illustrati<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>ons
in those times: the central figure is holding in the air a
child (not shown except the foot) preparatory to dashing it
upon the ground, while the soldier to the right has the decapitated
head of a child, also not reproduced, in his left hand.
The coif-de-mailles are in all three examples peculiar in
being continued as a pectoral; in two cases they are constructed
of banded mail, and in the third of studded
jazeraint. Two hauberks are shown, one of banded mail and
the other of jazeraint. The central figure has genouillières
of leather which, like those of his companions upon his left,
are apparently continuous round the joint: the strips of
pendent leather from them have been sewn over the shins
and calves, while studded strips over chausses of the same
material cover the lower limbs of his comrade. The third
figure has simple chausses of banded mail with no reinforcement:
long swords with characteristic pommels are worn,
and the whole group is a most striking example of the lack
of uniformity at the period. Also see Figs. <a href="#fig149">149</a> and <a href="#fig150">150</a>.</p>

<p><i>Archers.</i>&mdash;From the time of the Norman Conquest the
practice of archery assumed an importance which did not fall
to its lot before in England. The Saxons had not paid particular
attention to this arm from a military standpoint,
only using it in sport, and the success of the Normans at Hastings
was due in a great measure to the skill and superior numbers
of their archers. The latter are shown on the tapestry
both in hauberks and without, and one is seen on horseback.
The bow appears to be of the simplest form of construction,
and the arrow decidedly not the cloth-yard shaft of a later
age. It became a custom from a very early date for the
archer to bear a stake sharpened at both ends which the
front ranks drove firmly into the ground with the secon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>d
and uppermost point sloping from them, while the rear
ranks filled up the intermediate spaces with theirs. When
protected thus in front and on both flanks it was found
that the archers of England could defy the charge of
the heaviest cavalry. Already in the twelfth century
the English began to develop that prowess in archery
which subsequently made them renowned throughout the
Continent of Europe. At the siege of Messina by Cœur
de Lion we are told by Richard of Devizes that the
Sicilians were obliged to leave their walls unmanned “because
no one could look abroad but he would have an arrow
in his eye before he could shut it,” while Richard himself
did not disdain the use of the weapon, but used it personally
with deadly effect when besieging Nottingham Castle,
defended by the adherents of his brother John. Among
the enactments of Henry I. of England it was provide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>d
that if any one practising with arrows or with darts should
by accident slay another it was not to be visited against
him as a crime.</p>

<p>It was during the period now under consideration,
1250 to 1325, that the archer first stepped into
prominent notice, and that the efficacy of his weapon,
the most deadly that the art of man devised until the
introduction of gunpowder,
came to be fully recognised.
During the Norman period
the infantry as a rule were
armed with the bow, but the
other weapons they bore were
considered of equal if not
greater usefulness and importance
in battle, owing probably
to the undeveloped
condition of the weapon.
With the advent, however,
of the long-bow proper, and
the invention of the arbalest,
the deadly effect of the arrow
and the quarrel began to be fully recognised and accepted,
and changes consequently occurred in the art of warfare
occasioned by the adoption of these weapons. The bow
was not at first considered to be of exceptional efficiency
in the open field, but to be especially valuable in sieges, and
the defence of mountain passes and strongholds. When this
idea was proved to be erroneous we find from various
Statutes of Arms that a number of the military tenants
were ordered to be provided with the long-bow and arro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>ws.
The Statute of Westminster, for instance, especially mentions
the bow. Their equipment was considerably augmented
also with respect to body armour, for in <a href="#fig109">Fig. 109</a>
on p. <a href="#Page_94">94</a> we see the bowman of <i>c.</i> 1220 defended only
by his chapelle-de-fer, whereas in Figs. <a href="#fig153">153</a>, <a href="#fig155">155</a>, taken
from Roy. MS. 20, D 1, dating from the end of the century,
when the conical heaume had been generally adopted, the
archers are depicted
with the same headgear
and the body
defended by a hauberk
of banded mail.
Whether arrows
were ever furnished
with the small cross-pieces
as shown is
conjectural; they
are, however, often
shown in MSS. having
a foreign origin.
In <a href="#fig154">Fig. 154</a> the archer
is seen clad in a coif-de-mailles and hauberk. The arrow-head
is usually barbed as shown, but whether the three-barbed
arrow of Spain, shown in the Spanish Codex, Add. MS.
11,695, written in 1109, was ever adopted in England is very
doubtful. The fourteenth century showed the fullest development
of the bow, as we shall find, and during that period
the archer attained the height of his importance, but by his
equipment at this early period we may conclude that he was
taking an important place in the military force of the nation.</p>

<p><i>Arbalestiers.</i>&mdash;The arbalest or cross-bow was known
apparently as early as the fourth century, and is mentioned
in manuscripts of the tenth; it appears, however, to have
been chiefly used for sport that time. It was not
before the close of the twelfth century that it was recognised
as a military weapon, or is illustrated in manuscripts.
In the beginning of the twelfth century there appears
to have been an effort made for its introduction, but at
a council held under Pope Innocent II. in 1139, it was
placed under an interdict as a barbarous weapon and
unfit for Christian warfare, and this condemnation was
subsequently confirmed by Innocent III. In the meantime,
however, Richard I. of England and Philip Augustus
of France had sanctioned its use during the Crusade
in which they had taken part, Richard being the fir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>st to
advocate its use, and Philip acquiescing and subsequently
adopting his example. The cross-bow thus introduced
into England at the end of the twelfth century practically
became obsolete at the termination of the thirteenth,
when the long-bow almost succeeded in extirpating its
rival. This, however, was by no means the case upon the
Continent, where it was the leading arm until the introduction
of the arquebus, and throughout the thirteenth
century cross-bowmen became integral units of every
English army, sometimes being mounted. The King’s
Bodyguard, founded by Richard I., was formed partly
of arbalestiers. In the copious records left by Matthew
Paris, who died in 1259, the cross-bowman is continually
mentioned. His particular post was in the forefront of
the battle and upon the wings, where the heavy quarrels
discharged from his weapon were supposed to check the
advance of the enemy’s cavalry; and scarcely a battle is
recorded in that part of the thirteenth century where
the arbalestier is not credited with performing most
conspicuous service. In the battle near Damietta in 1237
a hundred Templars and three hundred cross-bowmen are
said to have fallen, and the Emperor Frederick in 1239,
writing to Henry III. of England, mentions the very prominent
part played in a campaign by the arbalestiers. In
the contest with Louis IX., Henry III. had seven hundred
cross-bowmen in his force, while the French had a vastly
greater number. In King John’s time the pay for a cross-bowman
on foot was threepence per day, while if mounted
he was paid sevenpence halfpenny or fifteenpence, according
as to whether he possessed one or two horses. Notwithstanding
the conspicuous successes of these troops they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
occupied an invidious position in other countries than our
own; for the knights and men-at-arms, if they perceived
the day being won by the prowess of the cross-bowmen, did
not hesitate to charge through their ranks in order to share
in the glory. This occurred many times upon the Continent,
though happily no record exists
of its happening in England.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 158.&mdash;Archer and arbalestier,
13th century.</p>
</div>

<p>Like the bowman of his time
the arbalestier was clad occasionally
in heavy armour. In
the annexed <a href="#fig158">Fig. 158</a> of an
archer and a cross-bowman,
from Add. MS. 15,268 and
dating from the close of the thirteenth century, the armour
of the latter appears to be of the tegulated or the scale variety,
though it is quite possible that it may be intended for
banded mail. Upon his head he wears a leather skull-cap
strengthened apparently by iron bands, under which appears
a linen or soft leather coif. A representation of a similar
skull-cap of leather (<a href="#fig159">Fig. 159</a>), ornamented with a strength<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>ening
device in iron which is prolonged into a nasal, is shown
upon one of the figures in the Painted Chamber, Westminster.
The pile of the cross-bow bolt is shown to
be quite distinct from the barbed head of the
arrow. In <a href="#fig109">Fig. 109</a>, p. <a href="#Page_94">94</a>, the cross-bowman
is represented as heavily armed in a pot-helm
and hauberk of mail. The supersession of the
cross-bow in England by the long-bow was
due to natural causes. It was found that
as the long-bow underwent improvements it
outclassed the cross-bow in more ways than one. A
powerful and skilful bowman could discharge half-a-dozen
or more arrows during the time necessitated for
winding up the cross-bow for a second shot; also the distance
covered by the arrow, together with its penetrative
force, were quite equal to that of the quarrel, and is
generally considered to have been superior. In consequence
of this rapidity of fire the English archer invariably beat
down the attack of Continental cross-bowmen, if equal in
numbers, and, very often, when they were in excess. Compactness
of troops was a great point in mediæval warfare,
and the bowmen could stand closer together with their bows
vertical than their brethren of the cross-bow with their
weapons in the horizontal position. There is little doubt
that the cross-bow was the ideal weapon for the ordinary
soldier of an ordinary race, inasmuch as little intellect was
required to direct the aim and little strength was necessary
if the usual mechanical means were used to bend the bow.
For the efficient use of the long-bow, on the contrary, a
keen judgment was an absolute necessity, and it was only
a race of considerable physical power that could put for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>th
the strength and maintain the exertion which the long-bow
demanded. It is undoubtedly a matter for national
self-complacency to reflect upon the fact that while the
British gradually discarded the cross-bow and adopted the
long-bow almost entirely, the Continental nations proceeded
in exactly the opposite direction.</p>

<p><i>The Hand Cross-bow.</i>&mdash;The cross-bow as at first introduced
was of a simple construction, and permitted of the
bow being drawn by the hands alone,
without the aid of mechanical means.
Such a bow is that shown in Figs. <a href="#fig109">109</a>,
<a href="#fig157">157</a>, <a href="#fig160">160</a>, &amp;c., which when required to
be strung was simply placed upon the
ground, the left foot inserted in the
iron loop at the end of the stock, and
the string drawn up with the right
hand, until it engaged in the notch.
This is termed the hand cross-bow.
The oldest arbalest in the Wallace Collection
dates from 1450, and is probably
of German construction. The stock is of wood
inlaid with plaques of polished stag-horn, which are beautifully
carved in relief. The bow is of great strength, partly
enveloped in parchment and leather painted, and the original
cord remains.</p>

<p><i>The Goat’s Foot, or Hind’s Foot, Cross-bow.</i>&mdash;The
apparatus to bend this bow is essentially a double lever
consisting of two pieces articulated together. The smaller
piece is divided into two distinct parts, each of which
terminates in a catch; one of these engages with the bow-string
and the other upon points on either side of the stock.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
The longer arm of the lever was drawn back, and the
catch with the bow-string followed it until, being brought
up sufficiently into position, the string was caught by the
notch and remained secure until discharged. An arbalest
is preserved in the Wallace Collection, dating from 1520,
the bow of which is built up of layers of cane, whalebone,
hide, and parchment, ornamented and painted; this bow
was bent by the goat’s-foot lever, a few examples of which
are to be seen in the Museum.</p>

<p><i>The Wheel and Ratchet Cross-bow.</i>&mdash;This apparatus is
affixed to the bow stock behind the trigger by a stout cord
which passes round the stock and holds the mechanism
firmly. It consists of a flat, circular, iron case which
contains in its outer periphery a small toothed wheel which
can be turned by a long handle. Passing through the
circular case and engaging with the small wheel is a straight
ratchet with one side cogged: this ratchet has a catch at the
end remote from the case which engages with the bow-string.
By merely turning the handle and so revolving the wheel
the ratchet is wound through the case, thus drawing back
the string to its resting-place. The apparatus is then detached
and hung at the belt until wanted again.</p>

<p>In <a href="#plate40">Plate XL.</a>, p. <a href="#Page_366">366</a>, taken at the Rotunda, Woolwich,
an arbalestier of <i>c.</i> 1450 may be discerned in the act of
winding his cross-bow by a one-handled moulinet, the head
of the stock, which is very short, resting on his knee and not
on the ground. It takes a weight of 400 lbs. to bend this bow.</p>

<p class="right"><i>A. F. Calvert</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Moulinet and Pulleys Cross-bow.</i>&mdash;A piece of iron bent
into the form of a stirrup is affixed to the stock (adjacent to
the bow in this case), similar to that of the hand cross-bow,
for the insertion of the left foot, so as to gain the largest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
amount of steadiness and purchase. At the butt end of the
stock, against the archers body, a system of fixed pulleys,
having cords running over another system of free pulleys,
is firmly affixed by the insertion of the butt into a socket.
The free-pulley system has a catch attached to it which
engages with the cord of the bow: by winding up the fixed
system with a small windlass having a handle on either
side, the free system approaches the butt, bringing with it
the string of the bow, which after a time is duly caught in
the notch provided for it. The tackle is then released and
hung at the belt until wanted. An excellent example of
Moulinet and Pulleys may be seen in the Wallace Collection,
dating from 1490 to 1500; it is constructed of steel, and is
in good preservation.</p>

<p><i>The Cross-bow à Galet.</i>&mdash;In this type the bow is bent
by means of a lever fixed to the stock, and was much used
in the sixteenth century for the discharge of stones, spherical
balls of lead, &amp;c. In order to afford a good purchase for
the lever, the stock between the bow and the string-catch
was very often curved downwards into a segment of a circle
and made of metal.</p>

<p><i>The Barrelled Cross-bow</i> was as a rule bent by hand,
although a short stick was occasionally used. A half-tube
covered the groove through which the quarrel travelled,
thus leaving a passage for the string. It did not carry to
any remarkable distance, but in spite of this was in much
request during the seventeenth century.</p>

</div>

<p>The missiles for cross-bows are termed quarrels, or bolts,
and generally terminated in a four-sided pyramidal head or
pile, being occasionally feathered with wood or brass. One
kind was so feathered as to cause the bolt to rotate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
upon its axis. The cross-bow did not altogether disappear
from the army. We find mention in 1572, in the
time of Queen Elizabeth, of cross-bowmen being part of
a force of six
thousand men
furnished by
the queen to
King Charles
IX. The slinger of this period
is well delineated in <a href="#fig161">Fig. 161</a>.
It will be perceived that he
carries no protection whatever
in the shape of armour; his
weapon is the staff sling or
fustibal.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p><i>Banded Mail.</i>&mdash;Toward the close of
the thirteenth century a new species
of armour made its appearance, which
is generally known by the name of
Banded Mail. It was in extensive
use for about a century or more, and
appears upon the knight as well as
upon the ordinary soldier. Chain mail
was apparently superseded by the
banded mail, though not entirely, as
the former appears upon regal effigies
and persons of the aristocratic families,
from which we may infer that the chain
variety was retained by those who could afford it and banded mail was used
by those whose means were limited.</p>

<p>As the structure of banded mail always presents difficulty to the
student, and many conjectures made at various times have as a rule
rendered the question more difficult still without solving it, it is obviously
not out of place in this work to deal comprehensively with the subject
and, it is hoped, to definitely decide the question. The premises from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
which we may argue are as follows:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 337px;">
<a id="fig162" name="fig162"></a>
<img src="images/fig162.jpg" width="337" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 162.&mdash;Banded mail: knight of the De Sulney
family at Newton Solney, Derbyshire.</p>
</div>

<div class="smaller">

<p>1. From the time of the first Crusade, or approximately about that
time, chain mail proper was the flexible defensive covering for the
English knight, and various kinds of jazeraint armour, in which leather,
metal plates, padded material, &amp;c., were indiscriminately used, for the
ordinary soldier. The chain mail was obviously too dear for the average
purse.</p>

<p>2. During the period mentioned above archery was in an incipient
condition, and bodily defences were adapted to withstand the weapons
in ordinary use, which, if we exclude the javelin, and, under extraordinary
circumstances, the lance, were hand and not missile weapons.</p>

<p>3. The simultaneous adoption of banded mail, not only by the
common soldier, but also by a large proportion of the knightly forces,
points conclusively to the fact that chain mail was no longer considered
an adequate defence; in other words that the adoption of a new arm
had rendered it inefficient, and that another description of armou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>r was
imperatively demanded to withstand its effects.</p>

<p>4. The use of leather as a means for bodily defence had been known
from the most ancient times, and in England had been freely used by
the Saxons, as we have seen. From the Conquest onwards it had steadily
advanced in favour, and culminated in importance in the first half of the
fourteenth century during the Studded and Splinted Armour Period,
not finally disappearing until the adoption of total plate defences
rendered its use obsolete. Its second rise into favour during the seventeenth
century is obviously not connected with this question, except to
emphasise the fact that leather has always been considered an efficacious
defence against sword-cuts, and also against missiles which are not
gifted with too great powers of penetration.</p>

<p>5. The fact that banded mail, whether seen upon the inside or the
outside, presents exactly the same appearance (see the Creke, Northwode,
and d’Aubernoun brasses) and is delineated in such manner in illuminated
manuscripts, and carved the same in monumental effigies, precludes
the supposition that rings of metal were sewn down or otherwise affixed
to a garment of leather, as had been the fashion with Saxons and
Normans. Unless, however, we suppose a total abandonment of leather
as a defence which had been growing in favour previously and which
culminated afterwards, we must conclude that leather in some form was
used in the construction of the mail.</p>

<p>6. The abandonment generally of chain mail and the adoption of
banded mail occurred synchronously with the extraordinary development
of the long-bow in the latter part of the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>7. Banded mail was of so flexible a character that folds are depicted
in garments constructed of this material; it was used for hauberks,
camails, chausses, sleeves, and, in short, for every purpose in which its
predecessor had been used.</p>

<p>8. It is represented in MSS. with a metallic surface. The colour is
always silver, white or grey of various shades, and gold. We have
therefore to devise a protection which shall be of greater service
than chain against arrows; which shall be comparatively cheap; in
which leather plays a more or less conspicuous part; which shall present
the same appearance when viewed upon both sides; shall be flexible;
and finally shall have a metallic surface or general appearance.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>The accompanying diagram (<a href="#plate14">Plate XIV.</a>) is taken from a photograph of
a piece of banded mail constructed according to our idea of the structure of
the mediæval defence. The rings are iron washers, 1 in. in diameter
and 1/16 in. thick. Through the centre of the washers a piece of leather
exactly as wide as the apertures passes from end to end. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
washers are arranged like rouleaux of coin, each one just covering the
aperture through the centre of the one below. Between each row of
washers a thick piece of leather is placed, the raw edges being visible
on either side of the mail where they have been rounded off with the
knife. The section of this leather band would be similar to that of a
dumb-bell, the centres on each side of the leather being hollowed so
as to permit the edges of the rouleaux to approach each other and
almost touch, the thin centre only preventing them. To the middle of
this leather band the individual rings of the mail are sewn of both the
upper and lower rows. The best portion of this example is that immediately
to the right of the white band. The appearance of both sides of this
example of mail is precisely similar; it is very flexible, and easily bends in
any required direction. The weight, however, would probably be prohibitory,
even to a mediæval knight, and in order to lighten it we may suggest
that every alternate washer be made of leather, or even that two washers
of leather alternate with one of metal. Against this it may be argued
that banded mail is represented with a metallic tint, but so also is chain
mail, which must have presented ordinarily a rusty-hued mass with
simply an outer surface of polished iron. The liability to rust of chain
mail must have been excessive, and the two outer and accessible surfaces
were undoubtedly the only portions usually polished. So well known
is this fact that in the pageants now prevalent brown string is knitted
to represent chain armour, the outer surface being subsequently covered
with a metallic medium. As a consequence the limners of banded mail
would represent it with a metallic surface even though it presented as
brown or rusty an aspect as chain mail. The washers used in the
modern example would in the mediæval period be flattened rings of
metal, and the excessively coarse and large banded mail would be oval
rings and not circular. The bands are at times represented by single
lines, and the suggestion is obvious that the lines simply represent the
junction of the rouleaux which have not the extra defence of the bands
of leather, or else the band is so narrow that one line is sufficient for
its representation.</p>

<p>We will now deal with its efficiency for defence against arrows, which
appears to have been the chief reason for its being called into existence.
These missiles would strike either upon the rouleaux or upon the bands,
and would impinge either at a right angle to the plane of the surface,
or at any angle less than a right angle. An arrow striking the rouleaux
at right angles would endeavour to pass through (1) the thickness of
a metal or leather disc; (2) the leather running through the discs;
(3) the thickness of a metal or leather disc at the rear. If it str<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>uck a
metal disc, however, there would be a deflective tendency either to right
or left, according to the slant of the disc.</p>

<p>An arrow striking at an acute angle upon the rouleaux would glance
off if the discs slanted in its direction; if the discs sloped from it the
arrow might insert itself between two of them, penetrate the band of
leather running through the centres, and then endeavour to pass between
two discs at the back. So tightly, however, would these discs be
pressed together, by the leverage of the arrow-head itself in enlarging
the opening between them in the front, that it is questionable if the
inertia remaining in the arrow would enable it to overcome such resistance,
remembering that the discs are firmly fixed both at the top
and bottom to the leather bands. If an arrow struck upon one of
the bands it would have to penetrate at least half-an-inch of leather and
force apart the rouleaux firmly sewn, or affixed in other ways, to the
band on either side.</p>

<p>The specimen of banded mail constructed in accordance with the
foregoing method possesses in actual practice the resisting power claimed
for it; the apparent weak point is the penetrability between the discs.
If, however, the rings are firmly sewn to the lateral bands the resistance
to an arrow is almost if not quite equal to that of any other part of the
mail; the arrow becomes firmly fixed in the discs without penetrating
to the body. It is an unsettled question as to whether or not complete
armour of leather discs was ever introduced into England: certain it
is that the armour of William Longuespée, first Earl of Salisbury, in
Salisbury Cathedral was originally painted brown, but that might signify,
as we have said before, rusty chain mail and not leather; whereas upon
the few sculptured effigies in banded mail preserved to us the colouring
has altogether disappeared.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>THE CYCLAS PERIOD, 1325-1335</h3>


<p>Probably at no time in the history of defensive armour
has it presented a more picturesque appearance than during
the brief ten years of the Cyclas Period. Fitting closely
to the figure, the various garments followed the outlines
of the human form, and in no parts showed any marked
peculiarities or eccentricities. The evolution of the style
was undoubtedly derived from the experience gained during
the Chain Mail Period, when that defence was proved to
be ineffectual against the terrible effects of lance and
sword. Both of these weapons, even if they did not actually
pierce the mail, either bruised the body, or broke
bones, and thereby incapacitated the wearer; while the
protection afforded by the loosely hanging folds of the
surcoat of previous periods, especially against sword-cuts,
has been duly noted. Hence during the Cyclas Period
we meet with the introduction of multitudinous coverings,
whereby the lance, the sword, and the arrow were
opposed by plate and mail, and by various padded garments
of a textile nature. The superposition and nature of the
defensive equipment will now be described.</p>

</div>

<p>1. <i>The Haqueton.</i>&mdash;This consisted of a stuffed and padded
garment covering the whole body from the neck to the
knees, and the upper part of the arms; it rested immediately
upon the under-shirt of wool. The padded character
of the garment may be seen from the Creke and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
d’Aubernoun brasses, where the lower edge reaches the
genouillières. In the Clehongre effigy the haqueton, though
doubtless worn, is not apparent. The padding, besides
being defensive, served to protect the body
from the pressure of the mail and plate defences.</p>

Church, Cambs.</p>
</div>

<p>2. <i>The Hauberk.</i>&mdash;During the Cyclas
Period this garment appears to have been
generally made of banded mail, which consisted
of rings or discs firmly attached on
two sides to bands or strips of leather,
and overlapping each other right and left
in alternate rows. The protection afforded
by this defence was so good, and the flexibility
so great, that banded mail was in very
common use during the greater part of the
fourteenth century for hauberks, camails, and
chausses. The hauberk either terminated in
a point in front at the knees, in similar
fashion to the camail, or was rounded, or
cut squarely off, according to the individual
taste of the wearer. The sleeves in nearly
all cases terminate a little below the elbow. It probably
extended well up the neck and reinforced the camail.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Breastplate, or Plastron-de-fer.</i>&mdash;So far as we
are aware no exact description of this defence is extant; we
only know that it was of steel, that it covered the upper part
of the front of the body, that it was invariably of a globular
shape, and that it was securely attached to the hauberk, but
whether it had a companion backplate so as to form an
entire cuirass is entirely conjectural.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
Staples were affixed to it for chains,
which at that period were so often
attached to the hilts of the swords
and daggers, and sometimes also to
the great heaume, the chain seen in
the Northwode brass being for the
latter purpose. The globular form
it imparted to the cyclas is well seen
in monumental effigies, but not so
readily discernible in brasses.</p>

<p>4. <i>The Gambeson</i> was a body-covering
stuffed with wool, padded
as a rule in vertical parallel lines of
needlework, and worn over the plastron-de-fer
and hauberk. In the
monumental effigy of Sir Robert
Shurland (who in the year 1300 was
made a Knight Banneret), engraved
in Stothard, we have probably a
unique representation of a knight habited
only in the gambeson, which in
this particular case is furnished with
sleeves covering those of the hauberk,
although as a rule it was sleeveless.
It fitted closely round the neck,
and reached to within a few inches
of the knee. In <a href="#fig163">Fig. 163</a> this
garment alone is shown, all other
details of the effigy being omitted.</p>

<p>5. <i>The Cyclas.</i>&mdash;This extraordinary
garment differed from its predecessor,
the flowing surcoat, in being laced up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> at the sides,
reaching to the knees behind and being cut short in front,
so as to expose the lower portions of the gambeson, hauberk,
and haqueton. It was of a thin material easily
falling into folds, silk being the ideal substance, and was
usually girded round the waist by a narrow cincture.</p>

</div>

<p>A great diversity of bascinets were in use at this period,
but all of them fitted
more or less closely
to the head, the chief
modifications being
in the extensions at
the side of the face
and at the back of the
head. In the typical
brass of Sir John de
Creke (<a href="#fig164">Fig. 164</a>) the
bascinet is fluted,
while an ornamental
apex furnishes the attachment for a crest or the flowing
contoise. To this headpiece is affixed the camail (or cap-mail),
a means of protection for the neck which was first
introduced at this period and remained in fashion for
nearly one hundred years, when it was superseded by the
gorget of plate in the time of King Henry V. The upper
portion of this camail was securely fixed to the bascinet by
means of staples or vervelles (<a href="#fig165">Fig. 165</a>), a cord or lace being
threaded through which may be perceived in the Creke brass.
A narrow strip of mail with a very ornamental border is
carried round below the rim. In all cases the camail covers
a part of the cyclas. The upper portions of the arm are
defended by demi-brassarts with coudières, while rounde<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>ls
fashioned to represent the heads of lions protect the joints
of the limbs. The forearms are entirely
cased in vambraces of plate.
The chausses are of banded ring mail
protected in front by jambarts and
genouillières, while the sollerets are
of mixed mail and plate. Upon the
effigy of Aymer de Valence, however,
who died in 1323 and is buried in
Westminster Abbey, only roundels
are shown protecting the upper parts
of the arm, and incipient coudières;
upon one of the small figures surrounding
the effigy a gorget of plate
of a very crude form appears to be indicated, superposed
upon the camail and lying also upon the cyclas (see
<a href="#fig166">Fig. 166</a>). Upon the
Creke brass there are no
indications that a visor
could be affixed if required,
but in the Add.
MS. 12,228 in the British
Museum a bascinet is
shown of an ornamental
character which is provided
with a small defence
of this nature which could probably be removed entirely if
required. The neck-guard is seen to be well developed and
to be provided with a projecting rim. Two small feathers
surmount the helmet, and were worn in place of the flowing
contoise (see <a href="#fig167">Fig. 167</a>).</p>

<p>The man-at-arms of the period<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
was provided with a bascinet which was more of the character
of a simple pot-de-fer; in <a href="#fig168">Fig. No. 168</a> an example
is shown to which a visor is attached and capable of being
thrown up when not in use. The sword is suspended in
front of the knight by a device which is very simple when
compared with that which formerly obtained; a belt passes
round the figure and the two ends are
affixed by swivels to the scabbard. The
weapon has apparently a 36-inch blade,
the quillons are straight, swelling slightly
at the ends and drooping in the centre;
the grip is swelling and wire bound and
has a wheel pommel. In Roy. MS. 16,
G. 6, many swords of this period are shown,
and are all characterised by their plainness
and simplicity of form (<a href="#fig169">Fig. 169</a>). The
brass of Sir John d’Aubernoun who died
in 1327 and lies in Stoke d’Aubernoun
Church, Surrey, shows a figure similar in
most respects to the Creke brass. The roundels at the elbows
are fixed by arming-points, the helmet is less elaborately
decorated, the method of fastening the sword is old-fashioned,
and he wears pryck spurs and not roundels as shown in
the Creke brass. A very noteworthy and curious brass
of this period is that at Minster in the Isle of Sheppey, in
memory of Sir John de Northwode, who died <i>c.</i> 1330. The
bascinet is of a peculiar swelling form so suggestive of the
globular head-pieces fashionable on the Continent at that
period, and the camail is finished over the chest in engrailed
escallops. A chain is joined to an ornamental staple attached
to the breastplate, and passes over the left shoulder to its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
attachment with the tilting helm. Only escalloped coudières
and roundels protect the upper arms
and scale-like plates of steel the lower;
these vambraces may possibly be of
cuir-bouilli, so prevalent at the period.
The grip of the sword swells considerably
and the quillons are short. Only
the upper part of this brass is shown
in <a href="#fig170">Fig. 170</a>, but it has been restored
and now shows the complete figure.
The shield at this period was of the
heater shape and small; it was concave,
so as to enclose the figure, and
a narrow guige passing round the
neck secured it. The effigies of
Prince John of Eltham, d. 1334, in
Westminster Abbey; that of Sir
John d’Ifield at Ifield in Sussex;
and also that of Humphrey de Bohun,
Earl of Hereford and Constable of England,
d. 1321, in Hereford Cathedral, and
the Pembridge knight at Clehongre
Church, Herefordshire, may be studied
with advantage as exhibiting varieties in
detail of this style of armour. A knight
of the Cyclas Period is figured in Cotman
having the same peculiar swelling helmet,
and also the addition apparently of a
plate gorget in place of the camail; this may, however,
be simply a leather covering for the throat (<a href="#fig171">Fig. 171</a>).</p>

<h3>THE STUDDED AND SPLINTED ARMOUR PERIOD,
1335-1360</h3>

</div>

<p>The Studded and Splinted Armour Period was essentially
an era of transition, intermediate between a mode of defence
which had proved inadequate by reason of its sheer cumbersomeness
and multiplicity of details, and the light and easy
effectiveness of the succeeding style, the Camail and Jupon,
which was ushered in about 1360. During the studded
mail period the prolonged struggle of King Edward III.
for supremacy in France occurred, and the fierce old English
blood found many channels for venting its superfluous
ardour. The defensive and also offensive equipment of
knight and soldier underwent many and sudden changes
as exigencies suggested, and keen was the contest between
the three styles then prevailing, viz. chain mail, cuir-bouilli,
and plate. From accredited sources of information we
glean that the partisans of chain mail passed through this
stirring period relying almost entirely if not wholly upon its
efficacy; the believers in cuir-bouilli clothed themselves in
fanciful garments of that material reinforced by a substratum
of banded or other mail; while the advocates of plate essayed
various departures of a more or less cumbrous character,
which must have proved abortive by reason of their weight
and crudity, although containing, as many did, the germs of
improvements which, when elaborated, made the armour of
later periods so effective. There were other experiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>ers
who believed in a judicious mixture of all three kinds of
defence, and as they far outnumbered the remainder the
period has gained the name which heads this chapter.</p>

<p>In an age which saw so many varieties, and when each
man did that which was pleasant in his own eyes, it is
difficult to distinguish essential characteristics by which the
amateur may readily recognise armour of this period, but a
few salient features may be mentioned which were fairly
persistent throughout.</p>

<p>1. <i>The Surcoat</i> or skirted jupon was sleeveless and fitted
the upper part of the body tightly, but below the waist was
made full so as to hang in folds to the knees; as a rule it
opened up the side, but sometimes was slit only a short
distance up the front and then laced at the neck. It displayed
the armorial bearings of the wearer above the
sword-belt, then worn round the waist or a little below it,
and in some few cases the skirt was dispensed with and
terminated at the belt. The lower part of the skirt was
either plain or escalloped, the latter feature sometimes
partaking of the nature of gadroons and extending upwards
to the belt. The skirt also at times was of a different
colour to the upper part, a feature which is well shown in
one of the windows at Ely Cathedral, dating from 1335,
where six figures are shown in contemporary armour, and
the skirts of three surcoats are darker in colour than the
upper part, one being ornamented with a band of a still
darker colour. All the skirts shown reach below the
knees and have no sleeves.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Hauberk</i> beneath the surcoat was of chain-mail
of various patterns, or banded mail, and reached to
the knees, being about an inch longer than the uppe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>r
garment. It was furnished with a high collar and with
sleeves reaching to the wrists, plate gauntlets being
almost universal at this period. The hauberk exemplified
all the various kinds of chain mail known in the mediæval
period. The banded mail, already spoken of in the preceding
period, had varieties; instead of the rings being
merely superposed as in <a href="#fig162">Fig. 162</a>, they were at times
interlinked and given a slight twist, so as to lie flat similarly
to an ordinary curb chain, each of these continuous
chains being sewn to the usual raised leather band on
either side. In some examples, chains of large and thick
links an inch or more in diameter are shown merely
fastened down to the under leather or material without
any separating bands. But probably the most effectual
defence, though of enormous weight, was the usual system
of putting rings or discs of metal face to face, like rouleaux
of coins, and known as the pure banded mail, which afforded
effectual protection against the deadly arrow of the period,
which could neither penetrate nor force apart the tightly
wedged discs. We read of knights emerging from the
fray bristling with arrows, which were pulled out of their
harness by the squires.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Breastplate</i> was undoubtedly worn at this period,
as the globular conformation of the upper part of the body
and the chains sometimes affixed to that part through
the surcoat prove. It can hardly be imagined that these
chains could be fastened to a hauberk. It is probable that
the breastplate was always worn immediately below the surcoat;
and there are indications that the haqueton or gambeson
was sometimes worn at this period under the hauberk.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>
<p>4. <i>Chausses</i> of mail were universally worn protecting
nearly the whole length of the legs and covering the feet.</p>

(Add. 12,228.)</p>
</div>

<p>So far as uniformity is concerned, the four articles
enumerated above are all that can be
cited with any degree of accuracy.
The bascinet of the period was of
many and varying shapes, and at times
approached the grotesque. Two are
given here from Roy. MS. 16 G. 6
(Figs. <a href="#fig172">172</a>, <a href="#fig173">173</a>), which are adorned
with acanthus-shaped crests: the
camail depending from both is of
banded mail, and the vervelles by
which it is affixed are shown. It is probable that this
style prevailed more upon the Continent than in England.
The form of helmet shown in the Ely window before
mentioned is globular, the lower part covering the
ears and cheeks; a comb much flattened and of no great
height traverses it from the forehead to the back of
the head. A common form of bascinet is shown in
<a href="#fig174">Fig. 174</a>, which covers the head and neck, and i<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>s provided
with one of the cumbrous visors of the age. This
revolves upon pivots fastened well
back, and not only protects the
face, but partly fulfils the duty
of a gorget. The occularium is
formed by a row of circular apertures
in a reinforcing plate. This
massive form of visor is well shown
on the head of Thomas de Beauchamp
(<a href="#fig175">Fig. 175</a>) on the celebrated
Hastings brass, one of the few
brasses of this period of armour
which have been handed down
to us, and which in consequence is simply invaluable.
The visor is provided with a reinforcing plate and slits for
the occularium, with breathing holes below, while the
great projection at the lower part (when allowed to fall)
not only protects the neck, but also a portion of the
chest. A bascinet is preserved in the British Museum
which dates from <i>c.</i> 1350, and illustrates the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> manner in
which the gorget
plate was affixed
(<a href="#fig176">Fig. 176</a>). The
bascinet of Almeric,
Lord St.
Amand (<a href="#fig177">Fig. No.
177</a>) is provided
with a singular
adornment, the
chapelle-de-fer or
steel bonnet: the
brim, being movable
upon pivots at the sides, could be brought down so
as to protect the face.
But such an arrangement
left the chin and throat
open to injury, and to
obviate this a mentonnière
of massive proportions is
shown, thus anticipating
the protection of the same
nature as required by the
salade a century later.
This illustration of the
chapelle-de-fer is the only
one engraved upon a brass,
but another example of it
on a monumental effigy
may be seen in Westminster Abbey upon an equestrian
figure on the tomb of Aymer de Valence, <i>c.</i> 1296. A late
example of the war hat dating from 1515 and of German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
make is No. 135 in the Wallace Collection, while a
pictorial representation of it may be seen in Julius, E.
IV., the life of Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick,
written at the close of the fifteenth century. Bascinets
not very unlike those in vogue in the reigns of Henry V.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
and Henry VI., and later on in the Tudor period, were in
use, as may be seen from the illustrations taken from
Add. MS. 12,228, Figs. <a href="#fig178">178</a>, <a href="#fig179">179</a>, and the romance of
King Meliadus, Figs. <a href="#fig180">180</a>, <a href="#fig181">181</a>.</p>

<p>In the spandrels of the canopy of a monument to Lady
Eleanor Fitzalan, wife of the first Lord Percy of Alnwick,
in Beverley Minster, who died in 1330, are seven military
figures exemplifying this period of armour, and in one or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
two cases the helmets are reinforced by a larger plate
which descends to the back of
the neck and to each shoulder,
over which it curves outwards
so as to nearly cover the camail.
These pieces are riveted on to
the bascinet proper, which is
generally furnished with a huge
visor.</p>

<p>A complete set of the figures
in the canopy are here delineated,
not in the cramped original postures,
but in erect positions.
They all possess points of difference,
and a comparison of the
various defences exemplified by
each will give an excellent idea
of the feeling which characterised
the armour of this difficult
period (<a href="#fig182">Figs. 182-188</a>).</p>

<p>The shoulders were generally left unprotected, except
by the mail of the hauberk, but occasionally roundels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> are
used similar to those of the Cyclas era. Demi-brassarts
covered the upper arms, shown in many
illustrations of the period as overlapping
lames of plate, occasionally complete and
protecting the front as well as the back
of the limb. Coudières, if worn, were
invariably of cuir-bouilli, and of a pattern
which is almost stereotyped, and shown
in <a href="#fig191">Fig. 191</a>, the genouillières being of
similar design.</p>

<p>In Add. MS. 12,228 at the British

are depicted, and almost without exception
coudières and genouillières of this
pattern are shown.</p>

<p><i>Vambraces</i> were
generally dispensed
with, the hauberk
sleeve being deemed sufficient together
with the large cuff of the gauntlet.
Where used the vambrace or demi-vambrace
may be of plate, as in the
Cyclas Period, or of cuir-bouilli as
on the brass of Sir John de Northwode
on p. <a href="#Page_144">145</a>. They were also of
pourpoint as on the arm here illustrated
(<a href="#fig192">Fig. 192</a>). As this curious
variety of defensive equipment is now
mentioned for the first time, it may be stated that not only
in this period but in the succeeding, it was most extensively
used. Pourpoint in its simplest form is merely a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
padded garment; studded pourpoint, or studded mail, as
it was occasionally called, consisted of metal
discs or roundels, generally of steel, secured
by rivets to the padded garment, or to leather
or cuir-bouilli. These roundels were made
very similar to the modern stud, but with a
short neck; where large roundels are seen,
as in the vambrace shown, the smaller head
is buried in the pourpoint, or boiled leather,
and the larger back, as we should term it,
is visible. This is generally reversed in the
case of other defences which we shall have
to consider, where only the small heads
appear upon the surface for ornament, and
the real defensive disc is buried in the pourpoint.
It is probable from
the illustration that the
pourpointerie shown were
stiff, moulded pieces of cuir-bouilli slipped
on over the underlying hauberk sleeve.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Genouillières</i> were invariably of cuir-bouilli,
and where illustrated in MSS. or
shown in stained-glass windows are of a
yellow colour. There was not much
variety in form, and they generally followed
the design of the coudière. A simple
and very common form, dating from c.
1330, is shown in <a href="#fig193">Fig. 193</a>, from Roy. MS. 16, G. 6.</p>

<p><i>Cuissarts.</i>&mdash;There was seldom any special defence for
the upper leg, but occasionally haut-de-chausses of studded
mail are met with, especially as we approach 1350. An<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
effigy at Tewkesbury exhibits studded cuissarts, and may
be ascribed to <i>c.</i> 1350 (<a href="#fig194">Fig. 194</a>). Whether
this pourpoint supplemented the chausses of
banded mail or was worn in their place is a
moot point.</p>

<p><i>Grevières or Jambarts.</i>&mdash;These, if of plate,
are rare, but demi-grevières are common (<a href="#fig195">Fig.
195</a>). Perhaps the defence most in vogue
was of the splinted kind, which consisted of
parallel bands of steel arranged in vertical
lines and embedded in pourpoint with studs
showing, or affixed to cuir-bouilli. The latter
was often used for vambraces and cuissarts
(<a href="#fig196">Fig. 196</a>). Perhaps the
best example of splinted
armour and banded mail
combined is that shown
in the brass of Sir Miles
de Stapleton on p. <a href="#Page_187">188</a>,
and many references to
this style of defence will appear in the
chapter on the Camail and Jupon Period.
Sollerets, if worn at all, were invariably of the
pattern shown in the Creke brass, and seldom
covered all the upper part of the foot. Occasionally
we find the ubiquitous cuir-bouilli
being used, and a brass as late as 1375 shows
an example; it is that of Sir William Cheyne
at Drayton Beauchamp, Bucks. (<a href="#fig197">Fig. 197</a>).</p>

<p>This work would be incomplete without a reference to
the famous Hastings brass in
Elsing Church, Norfolk,
dating from 1347, which gives
details of armour of that most
interesting period of English
military history for which we
generally look in vain to other
brasses, to monumental effigies,
and to MSS. A full
description of this invaluable record has been
written by Mr. Albert Hartshorne, F.S.A.,
which appeared in <i>Archæologia</i>, Vol. 60, and
is more comprehensive than any account previously
published. He relates the recovery
of one of the missing figures from the Fitzwilliam
Museum and its subsequent restoration
to the original position
it occupied. The figure of Sir Hugh
Hastings occupies the centre, surrounded
by a much mutilated canopy, in compartments
of which are represented four contemporary
warriors, &amp;c. The work is of
foreign origin, possibly Flemish or French.
The bascinet is of the globular form so
well shown in French MSS. of the period;
it is furnished with a visor which would
come down well over the gorget. The latter is of plate,
and the first shown upon a brass; it is acutely pointed
in front and of massive proportions, and guards the nec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>k
and chin, thus anticipating the protective character of
the mentonnières a century later. It lies directly upon
the camail, and was doubtless articulated, fastening at
the back by buckles. The rings of the camail and hauberk
are very small, and show distinct signs of interlocking. The
usual skirted jupon of the period covers the body to the
knees, upon which is emblazoned the
Hastings Arms, a maunche differenced
with a label of three points,
which also appears upon the shield.
Roundels of unequal size protect
the arm-pits, that upon the left being
the larger; demi-brassarts cover the
upper arm, and demi-vambraces the
forearm, being arranged as in the
Bacon brass in Gorleston Church,
and the Fitzralph brass in Pebmarsh
Church (<a href="#fig147">Fig. 147</a>), whilst a roundel
protects the elbow-joint. The sleeves of the hauberk are
slipped off the hands, as in the case of Sir Robert de Septvans
(<a href="#fig146">Fig. 146</a>), and depend from the wrist, thus showing
the quilted haqueton or gambeson under the mail; the
latter is also apparent beneath the lower hems of the
hauberk and jupon, quilted in vertical lines. The cuissarts
are of studded mail, from which depend broad bands of cuir-bouilli
passing round the knees; upon the latter the genouillières
appear as a reinforcement provided with fluted
bosses curiously spiked. The legs from this point downwards
are missing, but a rubbing in the British Museum,
taken in 1782, shows that the figure wore mail chausses,
and that the feet were provided with rowelled spurs. Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
Hugh Hastings served in Flanders 1340 to 1343, and also
in Brittany: he took part in the operations at Bergerac and
Auberoche in 1345, and was present at the siege of Aiguillon
in 1346.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 199.&mdash;Figure from Hastings
brass, 1347.</p>
</div>

<p>In two of the niches of the canopy are the figures
representing King Edward III. and Henry, Earl of
Lancaster. The king holds a drawn sword but has no
scabbard; laminated epaulières and reinforced coudières
appear on each figure but no roundels; gorgets are absent
and the shins are protected by demi-grevières of plate.
Both the king and his cousin have cuissarts of studded
mail. Another figure represents Thomas Beauchamp, Earl
of Warwick; he carries a pennoned lance in his right hand,
and is chiefly remarkable for the visored bascinet (<a href="#fig175">Fig. 175</a>),
which, with its dependent guards for the neck and its huge
visor protecting the neck and part of the chest as well as
the face, may be compared with the armed figures from
the tomb of Lady Eleanor Fitzalan at Beverley, 1330.
It is similar to that worn by a companion figure, Ralph,
Lord Stafford, on the same brass, and also by that representing
Lawrence Hastings, which is now missing. The latter
is known to have shown a figure with a gorget of plate similar
to Sir Hugh Hastings, with roundels at the shoulders and
elbows. Another lost figure is that of Hugh le Despencer,
whose stone effigy may be seen at Tewkesbury.</p>

<p>The newly found figure is that of Roger, Lord Grey of
Ruthin; it shows defences similar to the others, but has
complete brassarts of plate, with demi-grevières, and the
gambeson appears above the mail collar. The figure is bareheaded
and leans upon a pole-axe, which would apparently
be about four feet long: the inclusion of this we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>apon is
remarkable so far as brasses are concerned.</p>

<p>The last figure represents Almeric, Lord St. Amand,
whose headpiece is extremely peculiar (<a href="#fig177">Fig. 177</a>). The
globular bascinet appears to be protected by a steel bonnet,
or chapelle-de-fer, having a wide projecting rim which
worked upon pivots at either side and could be brought
down when required level with the eyes, while the back
would afford some protection for the neck. A comb or
ridge is also shown, probably hollow, and enclosing a
similar small ridge on the bascinet, upon which it would
run as a guide. This is the only example of a headpiece
of this fashion engraved upon a brass, but on the monumental
effigy of Aymer de Valence at Westminster, <i>c.</i> 1296,
one of the equestrian figures is shown similarly habited.
The gorget is different from that of Hastings in being
hollowed out at the sides; it rests directly upon the
camail, which is shown with very large and coarse
markings.</p>

<p>In all the figures the sword is suspended at a single
point and not at two as in the Cyclas and previous periods,
while the cord round the waist is also dispensed with. The
woodcut heading our Preface indicates crudely the armour
prevailing in this period. The subject of the illustration
is unknown, but it probably represents an episode at a
mediæval garden-party, where a section of the guests
indulge in a little “gentle and joyous sport” for the
edification of the others.</p>

<p>In connection with the armour of the Studded and
Splinted Periods the representation of the sovereigns of
England upon the coinage is of considerable interest,
inasmuch as it illustrates in a remarkable degree the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
extraordinary conservatism of the moneyers and die-sinkers
of the mediæval period. The first representation of regal
defensive equipment occurs in the reign of King Edward
III., and in the Studded and Splinted Period. The gold
noble of the second coinage of this monarch represents him
standing in a ship bearing a shield upon his left arm
and a sword in his right. The shield is large and heater-shaped,
and the sword has a short grip, a globular pommel,
and short quillons drooping towards the blade, which is
long, and narrows gradually towards the point. Camail
of very capacious extent covers the body nearly to the
waist and extends down the arms to the elbow; from below
this the sleeve of a mail hauberk appears, covering a small
portion of the forearm and pendent about a foot. The
forearm is apparently unprotected, but a gauntlet covers
the right hand, which alone is visible. Upon the jupon
appearing below the camail are four studs, indicating
pourpoint defence. In 1346, the half-noble exhibits a
much more contracted camail, a tightly fitting jupon with
short sleeves, and the sleeve of a chain mail hauberk
apparently reaching to the hand. The noble of 1351
shows camail, a short-sleeved jupon revealing a hauberk
reaching to the elbow, from beneath which issues a loose
sleeve to the wrist, of soft folding material, probably part
of the gambeson. The jupon is loose and plain to the
waist, below which appears studded work. The half-noble
is the same, except that the chain mail hauberk reaches
to the wrist. In 1360, the noble presents the same
characteristics with regard to the camail and jupon, but
a loose sleeve, fringed at the wrist, is apparently attached
to the jupon. The half-noble of the same date has a rough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
indication of a coudière, with mail brassarts or hauberk
sleeve, and a gauntlet.</p>

<p>Richard II. nobles have the camail with a tippet of
material reaching nearly to the waist, below which appear
the studs; the arm is encased in the short sleeve of the
jupon, and a long sleeve of material beneath it; but on
the half-noble a hauberk sleeve of mail is depicted to the
elbow. Henry IV. is represented in his first coinage habited
almost the same as his predecessor, but in 1412 a gold
noble was issued showing the arm in a brassart, coudière,
and vambrace, but with the same unaccountable studs below<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
the waist. The gold coins of Henry V. continued to be
of the same pattern as those of Henry IV. In Henry VI.’s
first coinage the arm is encased in laminated brassarts,
coudière, and a scoop-shaped piece of chain mail emerging
from the coudière and reaching nearly to the wrist, where
a gauntlet or glove with a flexible cuff is shown. Otherwise
the coin is the same as in Henry IV.’s time. The
rose-noble of Edward IV. exhibits the same characteristics,
as does also the angelet. With this reign the type of the
king standing in a ship ceases, but is revived again in the
time of Henry VIII., whose first coinage comprehended
a regal on which the peculiar scoop-shaped piece of mail
upon the arm is shown, an indefinite kind of cape serves
for the upper part of the person, and the inevitable studs
appear below the belt. On the George noble, issued
between 1526 and 1533, we get, for the first time in more
than a hundred years, an approximation to contemporary
armour in the figure of the Saint, who is clothed in Maximilian
plate from head to heel, with large pike-guards
appropriate to the time. On subsequent coins of Edward
VI., James I., and Charles I. the armour is correct.
Summarising the above respecting the persevering studs
we find them represented on coins a century and a
half after they ceased to be worn; camail is shown sixty
years after it was disused; plate does not appear until a
hundred years after it came in vogue, and the drooping
sleeve of mail, though used on the Continent, was not seen
in England after the Cyclas Period. Speaking generally,
Richard II. and the monarchs immediately succeeding had
the pleasure of seeing themselves represented upon the
coinage in the same equipment as the ordinary soldier <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>of
the time, with the sole exception of the crown. Upon the
silver coinage the head only of the monarch is represented
until we come to the reign of Edward VI., when the
Maximilian type is shown, and subsequent coins exhibit
contemporary armour.</p>

<p>With the advent of the camail and jupon we enter upon
a period which presents a certain amount of uniformity,
and is in marked contrast to the tentative styles which
preceded it. Throughout the Surcoat, Cyclas, and Loose-skirted
Jupon Periods, defensive armour was in a state of
transition; warriors sought to render themselves immune
by every conceivable expedient, discarding those which
failed upon trial, and augmenting those which proved efficacious.
The cumbrous mentonnières and gorgets of plate;
the enormous visors; the great globular bascinets; the
multiplicity of garments in the Cyclas Period, and the indiscriminate
use of cuir-bouilli, horn, pourpointerie, chain,
and plate, in that which followed, were all in this period
relegated to the limbo of forgetfulness, and a uniformity
of attire was adopted which was the more striking when
compared with those which immediately preceded it. This
similarity or prevalence in fashion in military dress has
lasted to the present time, for in all the different periods
we shall deal with after this uniformity commenced, we
shall notice that certain features are prominent, and
that only minute deviations call for our attention. As
human knowledge is but the consolidated result of experience,
so we may attribute the Camail and Jupon Period
to the French wars of Edward III. and Philip of Valois,
which for nearly twenty years devastated France, and in
which the two decisive battles of Cressy, 1346, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
Poictiers, 1356, are included. During that long period
the various defences underwent the fiery ordeal of actual
use, and only those which emerged triumphantly from the
struggle were retained.</p>

<p>To the student of armour and arms, this period is of
exceptional interest by reason of the unwonted facility
with which it may be studied, inasmuch as there is hardly
a cathedral, or church of any importance in the kingdom,
which does not possess, in some manner, details of military
equipment relating to it. Brasses and monumental effigies
simply abound, stained glass is by no means uncommon,
while carvings in wood and stone exhibit details which
are at times of great importance. The wealth of technical
matter thus preserved enables the student to reconstruct
the period with a fidelity which is wanting in those earlier.
It must not be supposed that the great and salient features
of the style were at once adopted; there was a transition
period of nearly twenty years, during which the old
defences were in part retained, and only discarded by
degrees. Before pointing out these exceptions, however,
it may be as well to take the several features of the equipment
in order, as has been done in preceding styles.</p>

</div>

<p><i>The Jupon.</i>&mdash;The jupon was a sleeveless outer garment
reaching from the neck to midway between the hips and
the knees. It was tight-fitting, as may readily be gleaned
by inspection of brasses and effigies, and no folds or creases
can be observed in it. In construction it consisted of
several thicknesses of material sewn through, thus becoming
almost homogeneous, and upon this firm sub-structure a
layer of silk, velvet, or other rich material was firmly
fastened down, and bore in the great majority of cases the
armorial insignia of the wearer. There are exceptional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
cases in which the jupon was stuffed and quilted. The arm-holes
became decorated in the later years of this style, but
owing to the covering camail we have no knowledge of
any decorations upon the neck. The skirt was finished
with an enriched border of either escallops, or acanthus
leaves, or dags&mdash;dagging being a mode of ornamenting the
hems of civilian garments prevailing in the reigns of
Edward III., Richard II., and the fourth and fifth Henrys;
it consisted in cutting out borders of sleeves, skirts, &amp;c.,
into open work of various devices. This rich and splendid
covering to the real body defences was always laced up at
the sides, occasionally only on one side, under the left arm.</p>

</div>
<p><i>The Breastplate.</i>&mdash;This was worn underneath the jupon
and over the hauberk to which it was affixed, and gave
the swelling, globular appearance to the
knights so characteristic of the period; its
termination at the waist imparted a contour
of body almost wasp-like at times. We
are unaware of the form of this defence,
and also as to whether or not it possessed
a companion backplate, so as to form a
complete cuirass; however, the appearance
of the back of many effigies of this period
leads to the supposition that a similar plate was used to
protect that part of the body. In the MS. Roy. 15, D. 3,
a foreign knight is shown wearing his breastplate upon his
jupon, and it is of the form depicted in <a href="#fig203">Fig. 203</a>; it may
perhaps be taken as the general shape of this defence.
Upon a sculptured effigy of the year 1370 in Bamberg
Cathedral, a copy of which is reproduced in Boutell’s
“Monumental Brasses,” a heart-shaped breastplate is shown,
but there are no British examples of the exposed defence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
In the Bamberg effigy chains are shown depending from
staples in the breastplate for attachment to the sword-hilt
and misericorde, and the brass of Sir Ralph de Knevynton
at Aveley, Essex, 1370, also
has this feature (<a href="#fig204">Fig. 204</a>.)</p>

<p><i>The Hauberk.</i>&mdash;During
the earlier portion of the
Camail and Jupon Period
the hauberk was invariably
constructed of banded mail,
but towards the end of the
century it was superseded
by linked chain mail, although
late examples of the
banded may be found, such
as that of Lord Berkeley,
1392, at Wotton-under-Edge,
Gloucestershire, and
Sir Nicholas Hawberk, 1407,
Cobham Church, Kent. The
defence reached to about the
middle of the thigh, and
subsequently to 1380 became sleeveless. The lower edge
appears as a rule about two inches below that of the jupon,
and is, in some cases, made ornamental by pendent rings,
as in the case of Sir Robert Swynborne. Under the hauberk
the quilted gambeson, or haqueton, was worn as usual, but
no portion of it appears in brasses or effigies.</p>

</div>

<p><i>The Bascinet.</i>&mdash;The bascinet was very tall at the commencement
of the period and acutely pointed at the apex;
it gradually lessened in height as time advanced. It
descended on both sides well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
over the ears, and was carried
round to the back of the neck,
as a rule, in a straight line.
The apex was not over the
centre of the head, but more
towards the rear; when the
knight couched his lance and
bent forward in the saddle the
point was thus brought forward
to a perpendicular position. This
detail cannot be perceived in
brasses, but is very apparent in
monumental effigies, and is
shown on the opposite page
(<a href="#fig206">Fig. 206</a>), taken from a stained-glass
window in St. Peter’s
Church, St. Albans, and approximately
of the date 1380.
The visor is represented in gold-coloured
glass, and this feature
of gold gilding is by no means
uncommon in MSS. of the early
part of this period, from which
it is possible to infer that the
visors were either of cuir-bouilli,
latten, or were enriched by gilding.
At first the visors were
removable at will, being merely
hung on projecting knobs at
the sides; but afterwards, when
the snout-faced variety came into
vogue, they were invariably fixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>, and could only be raised
or lowered. An earlier form of bascinet is shown in the
windows of the same church which has a close-fitting visor,
very similar to those which
marked the advent of the
pot-helm in the thirteenth
century (<a href="#fig207">Fig. 207</a>). Towards
the close of the fourteenth
century the adoption
of the “snout-faced,”
or “pig-faced” visor (<a href="#fig208">Fig.
208</a>) became universal,
eliciting much uncomplimentary criticisms from contemporary
writers and being the subject of many caricatures
in carvings of the period. In the Tower of London
a bascinet weighing 5¼ lbs. is
preserved (<a href="#fig209">Fig. 209</a>); the visor
or ventaille, which weighs
1 lb., originally hinged up to
a pivot in the centre of the skull. In the Wallace Collection,
<a href="#fig210">Fig. 210</a> shows a beautiful example which was
formerly in the Meyrick Collection; it is French, and
dates from <i>c.</i> 1400. An early example of this form of
visor bascinet is preserved in the collection at Parham
dating from 1365, which shows the ventaille partly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
covering the neck, and this form is common in the
Roy. MS. 20, C. 7, in the British Museum, dating from
1400 to 1415 (<a href="#fig211">Fig. 211</a>). Here, however,
the feature is made of such huge dimensions,
reaching doubtless as far as the
collar-bones, that a feeling is engendered
of disproportion, or of caricature; but as
the examples are very numerous, and all
appear the same, the thought is perforce
dispelled. Huge visors are also depicted
in a History of Richard II. of England
preserved in the Bibliothèque du Roi (a
figure from which is here shown, <a href="#fig212">Fig. 212</a>),
which must have provided a large amount
of breathing space and also acted to some
extent as a gorget. The bascinet termed
the Barbute is essentially Italian, and
does not occur upon any English brass
or effigy; it appears to have been prevalent on the Continent,
and some of the head-pieces shown upon the common
soldiery in English MSS. partake of the character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> of this
defence. It was worn without any visor, but a portion of
the camail, adapted for the
purpose, was lifted in order
to cover almost entirely the
small opening left in front,
being fastened to the staples
with which these helmets
are almost always provided.
The Barbute in the Wallace
Collection (<a href="#fig214">Fig. 214</a>) shows
this feature very distinctly,
as it is provided with two
staples for the purpose, while
the nasal thus formed by
the camail is well shown in
the effigy of Ulrich Landschaden,
1369, in Neckarsteinach (<a href="#fig215">Fig. 215</a>), which, however,
is defended by the
ordinary bascinet,
though strange to
note, the figure is
entirely without any
visible plate armour
for the limbs. A
bascinet with an iron
nasal of rigid form
is shown in the MS.
Roy. 14, E. 4, and
depicted in <a href="#fig216">Fig. 216</a>. It will be seen by the various
figures illustrating the Camail and Jupon Period that the
height of the bascinet became less towards the end of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
time when it prevailed, and showed a distinct tendency to
merge into the globular form of the succeeding period.
The bascinet of Sir William Burgate, 1409, in Burgate
Church, Suffolk (<a href="#fig217">Fig. 217</a>), is remarkable for
its high comb or apex, and is probably of
foreign origin.</p>

<p><i>The Camail.</i>&mdash;The term camail is said to
be a derivative of “cap-mail,” though one
authority deduces it from “curtain-mail.”
As we have seen in the preceding chapters,
this protection for the neck had been used
for centuries, but at no time did it attain
the dimensions and efficiency which distinguished it during
the period under discussion. It is probable that a
gorget of plate of some description was worn underneath
it, to which we shall refer when speaking of the epaulières.
The well-known representation from Nero, D. 7, in the
British Museum, representing the Black Prince receivi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a><br /><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>ng a
grant of Aquitaine from his father, shows the prince with
his helmet and its depending camail doffed, but no gorget,
however, is disclosed. At first the lower portion of the
camail fell almost perpendicularly to the shoulders, and
covered but a small portion of them, as may be seen in the
brasses of Sir John de Argentine, 1360, Horsheath Church,
Cambridge (<a href="#fig218">Fig. 218</a>); Sir John de Paletoot, 1361, Watton
Church, Herts (<a href="#fig224">Fig. 224</a>); and Sir John de Cobham, 1375,
Cobham, Kent; but as the period progressed, the mail expanded
so as to cover not only the shoulders, but the upper
part of the arm. At first banded mail was universally employed,
and examples may be found of its use even as late as
1405, on the brass of Sir Thomas Massyngberde, but by the
year 1380, chain mail of varying patterns had become popular.
The links were arranged either in horizontal lines or vertically,
and examples may be found where they vary in size
from that of a coarse dog chain down to extremely fine
links. For examples, see brasses of Sir John Wingfield,
1400, Letheringham Church, Suffolk (<a href="#fig219">Fig. 219</a>); Sir John
Hanley; Sir John Bettesthorne, Mere Church, Wiltshire;
Sir George Felbrigge (<a href="#fig220">Fig. 220</a>); the painting of the Black
Prince in St. Stephen’s Chapel, Westminster, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The method of attaching the camail to the bascinet was
by a lace running through staples termed vervelles, which
were visible until about the year 1387, when the fashion
was introduced of covering them with a more or less enriched
border. To the student this forms a valuable clue to the
date when inspecting a brass or monument, but must of
course be used in conjunction with other characteristics.
The brass of Sir William de Echingham, 1387, is one of
the latest showing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
this feature (see <a href="#fig221">Fig.

<p><i>Plate Defences.</i>&mdash;One
of the features
of this period was
the enclosure of the
limbs in plate defences
which conformed
generally to
the natural curves,
and present a striking
contrast to the distortions
which appeared
during the greater
part of the fifteenth
century. Upon the
shoulders laminated
epaulières occur, the
upper plates of which
are habitually hidden
by the camail and
jupon, but were probably
affixed to or
depended from the
gorget of plate before
mentioned. Brassarts o<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>f
plate enclosed the upper
arms, while coudières of a
close-fitting pattern protected
the bend of the arm.
There was no distinct fashion
during this period for the
outer projecting plate of the
coudière; at first a roundel
appeared as in the case of Sir
John de Argentine (<a href="#fig218">Fig. 218</a>),
and Sir John de Paletoot
(<a href="#fig224">Fig. 224</a>), but the general
form was that exhibited in the
brasses of Sir John Wingfield
(<a href="#fig219">Fig. 219</a>) and Sir George
Felbrigge (<a href="#fig220">Fig. 220</a>). Cylindrical
vambraces of one plate
guarded the forearms to the
wrist, where they were covered
partly by the cuffs of
the gauntlets. The latter
during this period attained
to a higher degree of perfection
than had previously
been the case, and great
attention was paid to detail
and careful fitting. The
fingers and thumbs were
distinct and articulated; a
plate covered the back of
the hand and another was
formed into a cuff. The <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>introduction of gadlings, or
spikes of steel upon the knuckles and joints, occurred at
this time, not solely for ornament but for actual weapons
of offence when other means had failed. In a trial by
combat fought before Edward III., one of the combatants
gained the advantage by striking the gadlings of
his gauntlet into the face of his adversary. At times
they are shown of great size, projecting a considerable
distance from the knuckles. Towards the close of the
fourteenth century the terminal parts of the finger-guards
are shown with imitation finger-nails,
and many of the gauntlets seen upon
the effigies are richly decorated. A
most interesting specimen, unique in
England and of great rarity, is <a href="#fig223">Fig. 223</a>,
in the Wallace Collection, dating from
the latter half of the fourteenth century
and of French make. The plates for
the fingers are missing; the covering
for the back of the hand and the cuff is formed of one piece,
with the exception of a small plate, which, however, is not
movable. The decorations are bands of latten. The
gauntlets of the Black Prince hanging over the tomb in
Canterbury Cathedral are often referred to; they are of
the same period as those in the Wallace Collection, but
made of latten, gilded, and cannot vie with them in workmanship.
The gadlings are well seen upon the various
brasses of this period, those of Sir George Felbrigge being
perhaps one of the most prominent (<a href="#fig220">Fig. 220</a>).</p>

<p>The mail defences for the lower limbs have the same
characteristic of following the outline closely, and of being
what may be termed skin-tight. The thighs were enclosed
in cuissarts of steel, back and front plates hinging up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>on
the outside of the legs and buckled between the thighs,
thus differing from the Splinted Armour Period, when front
plates only were invariably used. The knees were guarded
by genouillières of plate, which at first were of simple
construction, and consisted of a single plate (<i>vide</i> Sir John
de Argentine, <a href="#fig218">Fig. 218</a>), but eventually these were reinforced
by lames of steel above and below. Steel grevières
protected the shins and calves, and a small plate depending
from the genouillière, or from one of its lower reinforcements,
gave an additional protection to the front plate.
The sollerets were invariably of plate jointed, like the
epaulières, after the manner of a lobster’s tail; they were
long and pointed, and gave rise to the fashion which
prevailed until sabbatons were introduced, of pointing
the toe downwards through the stirrup when riding. At
the back of the knee-joints, and also at the joints of the
shoulders, elbows, and ankles, small pieces of mail were
introduced called goussets or gussets, being fixed generally
upon the garment worn underneath the plate, but at
times to the inside parts of the plate itself. They served
as reinforcements to the hauberk.</p>

<p>One of the peculiarities of the Camail and Jupon
Period is the magnificent hip-belt, of far more elaborate
workmanship and finish than in any preceding or following
age. It generally consisted of raised square or oblong
brooches, veritable triumphs of the goldsmith’s art, and
occasionally studded with jewels, linked to each other to
form a continuous band, and fastened in front by an
enriched morse or clasp. At times roundels were used,
and occasionally a running pattern in gold or embroidery.
In the early figures it is shown with a buckle and a loop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>,
a piece of pendent belt passing through and fastened like
the Order of the Garter. A brass exemplifying
very plainly the loop and buckle lies
in St. Michael’s Church, St. Albans, and
dates from <i>c.</i> 1370 (<a href="#fig223">Fig. 223<span class="smcap">a</span></a>). (It is remarkable
for showing two tabs of leather or
plate upon each shoulder,
issuing from beneath the
camail; we may have here a
replica of the French fashion
of epaulière at the period,
which generally was encircled
by tabs of cuir-bouilli.)
See also <a href="#fig218">Fig. 218</a>, Argentine,
and Paletoot, <a href="#fig224">Fig. 224</a>.
This seldom occurs upon
late examples. The general
method of wearing it was
horizontally round the hips,
but a few exceptions will be found
upon searching the engraved figures.
This fashion was copied by the ladies
of the period, who wore hip-belts,
showing beneath the super côte-hardi, of
equal richness to their lords.</p>

<p><i>The Sword</i> was attached to the belt
at the uppermost part of the scabbard,
and hung perpendicularly at the left side.
It generally had a wheel pommel and a swelling grip, with
quillons either straight or drooping slightly towards the
blade. The latter was about an inch and a half broad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
at the hilt, thirty inches in length, and tapered to the
point, while the section was either of a flattened or a
lozenge shape. It was double-edged, and had a grip of
varying dimensions, ranging from four inches in length to
an extent which, in some examples, almost suggest a two-handed
weapon, or the hand-and-a-half or bastard sword
of a later period (compare the d’Eresby and Felbrigge
brasses). The pommel, grip, and scabbard were at times
elaborately enriched with a profusion of ornament. A new
weapon was introduced at this period, the misericorde or
dagger of mercy, used for despatching a fallen foe whose
wounds were beyond all surgical aid, in the combat <i>à
outrance</i>, or in the field; or as a last resource for defence
when other weapons had failed. It was a straight dagger
with no guard as a rule, and having both the hilt and
scabbard curiously ornamented; the blade had but one
edge, the section being triangular. From its occurrence
upon many monumental effigies, we
gather that as a rule the misericorde
was attached to the belt by
a chain, but this feature is not as
a rule shown upon brasses. The
curious brass to Sir Ralph de
Knevynton, however, exemplifies
it, though the chains for attachment
of both sword and misericorde are affixed to the
breastplate (see <a href="#fig204">Fig. 204</a>). The misericorde of John
Cray, 1380 (<a href="#fig225">Fig. 225</a>), shows it depending at an angle
from the belt, while towards the close of the reign of
King Richard II. the knights have the weapon slung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
hilt downwards to the front, though this curious fashion
was soon discarded.</p>

<p><i>The Shield</i> in use at this period is but rarely shown, and
never upon brasses. Upon the tomb of Robert Wyvill,
Bishop of Salisbury, 1375 (<a href="#fig226">Fig. 226</a>), a shield
occurs which has a central boss riveted on
and is concave to the person; a projection is
shown at the upper part, upon the back of
which the guige is apparently fixed. In the
“Pilgrimage of Human Life” in the French
National Library we have represented the
discarded habiliments of a knight who is
departing upon a pilgrimage: the shield is
small, notched in the right-hand corner for the lance rest,
and presents a concave surface to the front. The snout-faced
visor upon the bascinet shows
it to be of the period now dealt
with. A sculptured effigy in Bamberg
Cathedral, dating from 1370,
has a shield which is notched in the
corner and also concave to the front;
while another shield from Hereford
Cathedral affords us an example of
an English pattern dating from 1375, which also is concave
to the front (<a href="#fig227">Fig. 227</a>). It occurs upon the tomb of Sir
Richard Pembridge. For the emblazoning of arms the
heater-shaped shield is invariably used.</p>

<p><i>The Heaume.</i>&mdash;During the period under consideration
the great heaume was in use for tilting purposes, the visored
bascinet being reserved for warfare. The heaume retained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
its conical crown in order to fit over the bascinet, but the
lower rim was still too high above the shoulders for the
latter to afford any support to it, and the curve as shown
is not adapted (<a href="#fig228">Fig. 228</a>); we must therefore infer that the
whole weight was borne by the bascinet, and that the inside
of the heaume was padded in order
to make it fit securely. In the
lower part of the front a hole or
staple is generally found, by which it
could be fixed securely by a thong
or chain to the cuirass. It is doubtful
whether any great heaumes are
in existence which date back to
the thirteenth century, and there
are only a few authentic examples
of the fourteenth. One of them
is the heaume of the Black Prince
in Canterbury Cathedral (<a href="#plate17">Plate
XVII.</a>), the upper part of which is
covered by the chapeau or cap of
dignity bearing the heraldic lion. No breathing-holes are
shown, and the occularium is extremely narrow. As weight
was apparently of no object at this period, a secondary defence
was often introduced in the form of a large plate of iron
covering the whole of the left part of the face, hinged at
the termination of the occularium upon that side, and falling
lower than the rim of the heaume, to which it was further
affixed by bolts and nuts. This <i>pièce de renfort</i> may be
viewed as the prototype of the “grande garde” of the succeeding
century: an excellent example is preserved in the
collection of Lord Zouche at Parham. It will be o<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>bserved
that the lower or cylindrical portion of the Black Prince
heaume consists of two pieces riveted together, and this was
the usual method at the time. In the heaume of Sir Richard
Pembridge, Hereford Cathedral (Figs. <a href="#fig229">229</a>, <a href="#fig230">230</a>), however,
the three pieces (cylinder, truncated cone, and crown) are
welded together, and the rivets are more for ornament than
for increased strength; the metal is thickened round the
occularium, and the lower edge is roped so as not to present
a cutting edge. There are a number of holes in the upper
portions to permit the aglets of the laces to be passed
through, by which the crest and lambrequins could be
attached to the heaume. In the lower front portion are the
two holes in cruciform shape to allow passage for a T-bolt
appended to the chain for securing to the breastplate.</p>

<p>A very rare example of the great heaume, which may
date from the early part of the fourteenth century, is one
preserved in the Rotunda at Woolwich. The crown is
conical; the visor hinges on the left side, and cl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>oses with
a spring on the right, and numerous small holes are pierced
in it for air. The occularium is a narrow slit above the visor
and below the crown. It is much corroded, and probably
when new weighed more than at the present time (9½ lbs.)
(<a href="#plate39">Plate XXXIX.</a>, p. <a href="#Page_364">364</a>). During the studded and splinted
style of English armour, heraldic crests had been introduced
as we have seen,
following upon the fan-shaped
decorations of an
earlier period: in the
latter part of the fourteenth
century all
warriors of distinction
adopted the fashion,
and subsequently all
men of knightly rank.
These crests were invariably
made of cuir-bouilli,
which material
allowed itself to be
moulded into any desired shape, and had the advantage
of being unaffected by the weather, besides affording
some protection from a sword-cut. Crests of all shapes,
sizes, and degrees of grotesqueness sprang into being,
some tending to enormous proportions and thus forestalling
the mantling of extravagant size so characteristic
of the fifteenth century. The contoise or flowing
scarf invariably accompanied the crest. A panache of
feathers was a favourite form of crest, by reason presumably
of its lightness and gracefulness; that of Sir
Wm. de Latimer, 1372, and of Edward Courtenay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span> 1400,
are reproduced as examples (Figs. <a href="#fig231">231</a>, <a href="#fig232">232</a>). As a foreign
specimen of the great heaume of the Camail Period we
may refer to the example preserved in the Historical
Court Museum at Vienna, dating from about <i>c.</i> 1360,
and known locally as the “Pranker heaume” (<a href="#fig233">Fig. 233</a>).
It is made of four strong hammered-iron plates with
smaller reinforcements, and
weighs about twelve pounds,
being probably used only
for tournaments. The crest,
two golden horns with silver
combs, is of the usual cuir-bouilli,
and weighs about
three pounds. A late
heaume of this period, dating
from <i>c.</i> 1410, is that of Sir
Edward de Thorpe, which is
of sufficient height to rest
upon the shoulders (<a href="#fig234">Fig. 234</a>). A panache surmounts the
elaborate coronet; the occularium is very high, and could
hardly allow of a bascinet being worn underneath. The
usual ring for affixing it to the breastplate is shown at
the base.</p>

<p>The orle or wreath is of the greatest rarity upon
monumental brasses of the Camail and Jupon Period;
Sir Reginald de Cobham, 1403, has a small jewelled orle,
however, and one of the same character is shown on the
brass of a knight of the d’Eresby family, 1410 (see <a href="#fig222">Fig. 222</a>).
This piece of ornament originated in the band of cloth,
silk, or velvet placed round the bascinet to support, and
act as pad to, the heaume, and subsequently, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
latter was discarded, remained to be

</div>

<p>The earlier effigies and brasses of
this period are in many of their details
exemplifications of the studded and
splinted style of defence, and are in
fact of greater use in that respect
than the few contemporary brasses
and effigies which remain and are
generally used as examples. The lost
brass of Sir Miles de Stapleton, 1364
(<a href="#fig235">Fig. 235</a>), once in Ingham Church,
Norfolk, is, for instance, an excellent
example, probably the best; he has a
studded jupon fitting tightly to the
figure and escalloped at the hem, with
haut-de-chausses or
cuissarts of the same
material. His genouillières are of single
plates with two rows of reinforcing cuir-bouilli
tabs depending below, while the
jambarts are of metal splints affixed by
rivets to the cuir-bouilli beneath. The
long pendent tab of the belt should
be noticed. The remarkable brass of
Sir Ralph de Knevynton, 1370 (see
<a href="#fig204">Fig. 204</a>), at Aveley, Essex, may also
be quoted as showing the same features
respecting the jupon and cuissarts; but the shape and
position of the belt, the great length of the misericorde,
its quillons, the crude genouillières, the long hauberk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
pointed in front, the pose and shape of the figure, and
the chains depending from the breastplate,
make this brass, which is of Flemish workmanship,
one of the most singular of its kind.
Sir John de Argentine, 1360 (<a href="#fig218">Fig. 218</a>) and
Sir John de Paletoot, 1361, have cuissarts
of studded material and pendent belts; Sir
Thomas Cheyne, 1368, also has studded
cuissarts, and jambarts of studded splints
similar to those of Sir Miles de Stapleton,
but his genouillières are most remarkable and quite unique.
They appear to be constructed entirely of cuir-bouilli with
pendent tabs of singular form reinforcing
the jambarts (<a href="#fig236">Fig. 236</a>).
The Cheynes appear to have been
a family addicted to peculiarities,
as Sir William Cheyne, 1375, has
laminated sollerets of remarkable
construction and also quite unique
(see <a href="#fig197">Fig. 197</a>). Sir Humphrey
Littlebury, Holbeach Church, Lincolnshire
(<a href="#fig237">Fig. 237</a>), has cuissarts
of cuir-bouilli with studs of an
ornamental form; his genouillières
are crude and of single plates, but
the hem of his jupon is remarkable
for graceful beauty, being deeply
dagged into acanthus-leaf form. A rich hip-belt has a
pendent tab at the side, but, strange to note, the sword
is not suspended by it, but has a separate belt passing
diagonally round the waist. This second belt is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
unfrequently found in sculptured effigies but seldom upon
brasses. The brass of Robert Albyn, <i>c.</i> 1400 (<a href="#fig238">Fig. 238</a>),
Hemel Hempstead, Herts, where two belts are shown,
has the sword suspended from both belts. Sir John de
Cobham, 1375, the founder of Cobham College, has
studded cuissarts and genouillières reminiscent
of those of Sir Thomas Cheyne. The
brass of Sir John de St. Quintin, 1397
(<a href="#fig239">Fig. 239</a>), in Brandsburton Church, Yorkshire,
is remarkable for the very wide and
elaborate hip-belt, which is fixed higher
than is usual upon a shortened jupon,
necessitating a small subsidiary belt from
which to suspend the sword, and also an
extra length of hauberk, which is curiously bent round the
limbs. The coudières are larger than usual, and together
with the genouillières are ornamented. After 1380, many
jupons are shown with fur round the arm openings, as in
the brass of Sir Nicholas Dagworth, 1401, where the great
length of the sword-grip, ornamentation of the armour,
great height of the bascinet, and elaborate hem to the
jupon are special features.</p>

<p>The years between 1400 and 1410 must be looked
upon as a transition period, inasmuch as features distinctive
of the Camail and Jupon and of the Surcoatless
overlap each other. For example, the brass of Sir Thomas
Braunstone, Constable of Wisbeach Castle, in Wisbeach
Church, Cambridgeshire, dating from 1401 (<a href="#fig240">Fig. 240</a>), has
taces, apparently five in number, although his neck is
camailed, the jupon being dispensed with; whilst Sir John
Hanley, who, together with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
two wives, is shown upon a brass
in Dartmouth Church, dated
1403, has five or six taces and
a shortened jupon, edged with
fur round the arm-holes, but
with a camailed neck.</p>

Tew Church, Oxfordshire, although
wearing camail, has a

is a strange mixture of
old and new styles; high pointed
bascinet and camail being blended
with palettes and taces. Lady
Wylcotes, who is shown upon
the same brass, wears the nebule
head-dress which went out of
fashion thirty years previously.
A knight of the d’Eresby family,
1410 (see <a href="#fig222">Fig. 222</a>), exemplifies
a strange mixture of transition
styles. The orle has been previously
noted, but the bascinet
is provided with a bavière which
is placed upon the camail. The
laminated epaulières are curiously
brought forward in order to cover
the goussets, over which they
form protecting arches. Round the waist is seen the
ornamental belt worn by all knights of that period <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>round
the hips; it carries no sword or misericorde and is therefore
purely ornamental, and, if we may say so, entirely
superfluous. The sword-belt across the body from the
right hip is the fashion of the Surcoatless Period. (A
knight in Laughton Church, <i>c.</i> 1405 (<a href="#fig241">Fig. 241</a>), also
exhibits this feature of the sword-belt, though otherwise
he conforms to the period.) A waved fringe of mail
appears below the five taces; the genouillières have prominent
projections over the knee-caps and are very ornamental,
while the sollerets have a decorative gousset of
chain mail. Altogether the armour is eccentric, and
probably both the wearer and his wife were of the same
character, inasmuch as the lady is shown in a reticulated
head-dress without the veil and the high-waisted gown
then only prevailing on the Continent. The knight’s
suit is beautifully enriched with a design which imparts
a very characteristic aspect to the entire figure.</p>

<p>With the advent of this period we find the knightly
defence consisting essentially, for the first time in English
history, of a complete suit of plate with no textile covering
whatever worn over it. Hence the term “Surcoatless
Period,” which distinguishes
it from any preceding or
succeeding era. The camail
was now finally abolished after
being in vogue in one fashion
or another for over one hundred
years. Its great recommendation
was mobility, as it enabled
the wearer to move his head
easily in almost any direction,
but the great detraction was
undoubtedly the weight. The
bascinet itself was heavy, but
when the thick curtain of chain
mail was added it must have
been almost insupportable, as practically the whole weight was
borne by the head. Now, however, a gorget of plate was
substituted for the camail (<a href="#fig243">Fig. 243</a>), and in order to relieve
the pressure upon the head still further, the bascinet was
so formed as to rest upon the gorget, to the upper part of
which it was affixed in such a manner that it allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
the head to be turned right and
left. Thus the defences for the
head and neck, instead of being
supported by those parts, were
transferred to the shoulders. The
bascinet, as it gradually developed
into the barbute type, became more
globular in form, although still retaining
the pointed apex (<a href="#fig242">Fig. 242</a>);
the lower portion which protected
the chin, and known as the <i>bavière</i>,
was riveted to the upper, generally
near the temples. The breastplate,
now visible for the first time, is of
globular form and provided with a
backplate; from it one can easily
perceive how the knights of the
Camail and Jupon Period obtained
the peculiar globose formation of
the upper portion of the body.
From the waist, and connected
with the breastplate, depended a
row of plates or lames of steel
overlapping each other and made
in various designs; these were denominated
the <i>taces</i>. To support
them a lining of leather or other
strong material was used underneath,
to which they were firmly
affixed. At first the skirt of the hauberk is generally
shown, similar to its former appearance under the jupon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>,
but after a time, probably about 1420, the hauberk was
discarded, and the knight relied for protection upon
his plate armour and padded gambeson alone. Round
the taces the hip-belt was worn horizontally during the
earlier part of this period, with the sword and misericorde
depending as in the time of the camail and jupon; but
subsequently the style was modified, and innovations crept
in which will be dealt with later. Laminated epaulières
were still in use to protect the shoulders, but instead of the
lames being prolonged in front to protect the goussets (as
shown in the Braunstone and d’Eresby brasses), a plate of
varying form, called a <i>palette</i>, was affixed to the cuirass by
a strap, which admitted of greater freedom for the arms.
The brassarts were often formed of lames of plate riveted
together, though the older form of front and back plates
was in use. The coudières are remarkable for the beautiful
fan-like shape of the outer plate, which was enlarged in
order to afford extra protection to the elbow-joint, and in
some cases was of very large proportions. The vambraces
show no change. The gauntlets were larger in the cuffs
than those of the preceding period: they retained the
gadlings and were often of most elaborate workmanship;
the fingers remained separate and conformed to the natural
shape, finger-nails being often engraved upon them to
complete the resemblance. The cuissarts, genouillières,
grevières, and sollerets, did not differ essentially from those
of the Camail Period, except in the richness of ornamentation
which was at times shown. One point, however, and an
entirely new one, is exemplified upon a few brasses&mdash;the
protection of the back part of the knee-joint by small lames
of steel. The skilful and costly nature of this defence
prevented its general adoption; it was revived, however, at
a later period, during the early part of the sixteenth century,
and became fairly prevalent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>The sword was but slightly altered from its former shape,
the chief difference being the quillons, which were straight
and of considerable length, and the general elongation of
the grip, whereby it developed into more of a hand-and-a-half,
or bastard sword, than formerly (<a href="#fig244">Fig. 244</a>). It should
be explained that in wielding this weapon the right hand
only would be generally used, but upon occasion, in order
to give extra effect to a stroke, the left hand could be
brought up to the pommel, which was invariably pear-shaped
in order to insure a firm grip. The misericorde was suspended
as usual upon the right side, but the point of the
blade is now directed towards the rear, and is generally
hidden in brasses by the body of the knight (<a href="#fig245">Fig. 245</a>). One
of the characteristics of this period should be specially
noted, viz. the mode of suspension of the sword by a narrow
band passing diagonally over the front of the body from
the right hip to the left side, and occasionally, but rarely,
furnished with a buckle. The inception of this style is
shown upon the brass of a knight in Laughton Church
which exhibits both hip-belt and sword-belt worn over the
jupon; it prevailed in England for approximately sixty
years (<a href="#fig241">Fig. 241</a>).</p>

<p>One of the earliest examples in brasses of this period
is that at Great Tew Church, Oxfordshire, referred to on
p. <a href="#Page_192">192</a> as being of a transition character, in consequence
of the camail appearing beneath the gorget. The bascinet
and bavière are in one piece, and the whole revolves upon
the gorget, which is probably prolonged upwards inside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
the headpiece. The placcates are
oviform; the upper lame of the
taces covers the lower part of the
breastplate; the hauberk and hip-belt
are in use, and the great
heaume is shown under the head,
to be worn as usual over the
bascinet. Robert, Lord Ferrers
of Chartley, 1407 (<a href="#fig243">Fig. 243</a>), presents
a very unornamental suit of
this earlier portion of the period,
showing the globular helmet with
the mentonnière riveted to the
upper portion and revolving within
the gorget; it should be compared
with the Wylcotes brass. Sir
Simon de Felbrygge, K.G., 1413,
is shown with the royal banner of
King Richard II., and wears the
diagonal sword-belt; he is furnished
with many lames in his epaulières
and has shield-shaped palettes,
while the coudières show the fan-shaped
plates in their incipient
stage. The Yorkshire St. Quintins
appear to have been eccentric in
the style of their armour. We have
referred to peculiarities in respect
of Sir John de St. Quintin and his
brass, 1397 (<i>vide</i> p. <a href="#Page_191">191</a>), and in that
of Sir Thomas de St Quintin, in Harpham Churc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>h, Yorkshire
(<a href="#fig246">Fig. 246</a>), we have more characteristic originalities.
The orle round the bascinet is of very large proportions, and
ornamented with a brooch in
front; the gorget consists of
three plates, the upper one
of peculiar form, showing ridged projections over the
cheekplates of the bascinet, while the epaulières are more
of the nature of the pauldron of a subsequent period,
in being composed of a single piece. The
arm openings are protected respectively by
a roundel and a shield-shaped palette, and
roundels are also used at the elbows, these
being strongly reminiscent of the early
camail days (<i>vide</i> Sir John de Argentine,
1360, p. <a href="#Page_175">175</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>The hip-belt is among the latest examples
of that fashion, having been generally discarded
by this date; it is very elaborate,
and suggestive in point of width of that of
the brass of Sir John de St Quintin in 1397 (p. <a href="#Page_191">191</a>). The
hem of the hauberk is wavy, and so also is that of the
gambeson showing beneath it; this is possibly the only
example of the gambeson being visible at this late period.
But perhaps the chief points to be observed are the lamina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>ted
defences for the back parts of the genouillières. If
they are lames they probably represent the earliest development
of this nature; on the other hand the artist may have
intended to represent banded mail, and omitted the small
vertical lines. The development of the fan-shaped coudière
may be well observed in the brass of Lord Camoys, in
Trotton Church, Sussex (<a href="#fig247">Fig. 247</a>), where the defence, both
inside and out, may be seen, but the strap or other fastening
joining the two sides of the opening is not shown. The
coudière may have been riveted to the brassarts and vambraces,
in which case it was not needed. A brass in which
the fastening is apparent is that of Peter Halle, <i>c.</i> 1420,
in Herne Church, Kent (<a href="#fig248">Fig. 248</a>), where the strap may
be noticed crossing the mail. Upon the brass of Sir
William Calthorpe, 1420, in Burnham Thorpe Church,
Norfolk, the bascinet is shown very highly ornamented
with a border; he also wears a collar of Esses round the
neck (<a href="#fig249">Fig. 249</a>).</p>

<p>The brass of Sir John Lysle (<a href="#fig250">Fig. 250</a>) in Thruxton
Church, Hampshire, bears the date 1407, and if the effigy
were executed at that time, or approximately so, we have
the earliest example of complete plate in existence in England.
There are, however, certain points about the armour
delineated which lend themselves to the supposition that the
brass was executed some ten or more years later, viz. the
absence of any hauberk; the development of the fan-shaped
coudières; the position of the misericorde and the sword-belt,
&amp;c. The distinction probably belongs to the Ferrers brass.</p>

<p>The brass of Sir John de Leventhorpe, 1433, at Sawbridgeworth
Church, Herts (<a href="#fig251">Fig. 251</a>), is interesting as showing the
development of the lowermost tace into the subsequent
tuilles of the Tabard Period. In this effigy the lame in
question is divided into two tuilles which still have the
same width, and partake of the nature of taces; each tuille
is suspended by two buckles. This is one of the earliest
representations of this feature in England.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>The shields used in the Surcoatless Period were similar
to those in the preceding, but manifest infinitely greater
varieties. They were invariably small in
size and notched for the lance, but as
every knight apparently designed his own,
it is obviously impossible to enumerate or
illustrate them. They all, however, agreed
in presenting a concave surface to the
opponents lance, whereby it was prevented
from glancing upwards or downwards and
thus inflicting injury, while the general
tendency was to deflect the lance-point
to the left, whereby it touched neither
horse nor rider. The examples here given
are from one of the Harleian MSS.,
No. 4379 (<a href="#fig252">Fig. 252</a>), and may be taken
as a general type of the knightly shield
in this and also in the preceding period.</p>

<p>Remembering that there was no arbitrary law regulating
the military equipment and dress of the ordinary soldier at
this period, it is somewhat difficult to deal decisively with
the subject, but a few examples and some broad outlines
may probably be sufficient to enable the reader to grasp a
general idea of the subject.</p>

<p><i>The Man-at-arms</i> in the middle of the fourteenth century
was generally armed with the lance, sword, and mace, the
martel-de-fer or a military pick at times supplanting th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>e
latter. The shield was heater-or heart-shaped and notched,
but sometimes circular, and of various sizes. A hauberk or
jacque reaching to the knees, and having sleeves to the
elbow, constructed of any
of the numerous kinds
of jazeraint work, or of
banded mail, covered his
body; it was reinforced at
the shoulders, elbows, and
knees with roundels, caps,
or plates, while two mammelières
were in use to
cover the chest and act
more or less as breastplates.
Greaves and vambraces
of leather strengthened
with splints of iron,
with thick leather gauntlets
and shoes, guarded the
limbs, while a skull-cap
with banded camail or a
thick leather gorget depending,
protected the
head and neck. Either a
gambeson or a leather tunic under the jacque completed
the equipment.</p>

<p><i>Billman, Pikeman, or Foot Soldier.</i>&mdash;The pikeman of
the period was equipped with a more elaborate defence
than is generally credited, and consequently his comparative
immunity from hurt by the lethal weapons of the time
goes far to explain the determined resistance made b<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>y the
infantry. The very fact that there was no uniformity in
his accoutrement rendered him a formidable foe to the
knight, who naturally directed his lance to that portion of
an enemy’s person possessing the least defensive equipment;
but it required more than human divination
in the excitement of a contest to discern the
weak points in the equipment of men all
armed in a different manner. The broad
rule respecting the armour of the infantry
in mediæval times was that the knightly
defence of one period became the soldiers
salvation in the succeeding period. At the
same time many a contemporary piece of
equipment was obtained from the field of
battle and used to augment the personal
defence. The figure (<a href="#fig254">Fig. 254</a>) (taken from
the British Museum MS. Roy. 20, C. VII.)
may be taken as a general type of the
billman of the reigns of Edward III.,
Richard II., and possibly Henry IV. and V.
Upon the head he wears a skull cap composed
of two pieces of iron riveted together
with reinforcing strips of metal; from this depends a
camail of banded mail which is strengthened by a plate
defending the cheeks, chin, and throat, in imitation of the
bavière then coming into vogue with the knightly class.
Possibly this piece was home-made, and the village blacksmith
had a hand in its fabrication. The body is protected
by a leathern jacque having roundels at the shoulders
with crude brassarts, coudières, and vambraces, possibly of
leather. A tegulated skirt of pieces of leather, horn, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
iron plates reaches to the knees, which are defended by
metal genouillières, from which depend
grevières of metal or cuir-bouilli. Indications
of cuissarts are apparent, and
the legs are covered with chausses of
banded mail in addition. It will thus
be seen that the billman’s equipment
for defence was but little inferior to
that of the knight. No sword or mace
is shown, but these were in common use.
The fauchard he wields is nine feet in
length, with cutting edges upon both
sides, a sharp pike-point at the end, and a hook with which to
dismount a horseman. A second example from the same MS.
(<a href="#fig255">Fig. 255</a>) shows a head-covering of cuir-bouilli
in the form of overlapping leaves or scales, while
the camail is of soft pliable leather. In this
cut the small badge is delineated upon the
left breast that denoted the leader under
whom the soldier fought. Another soldier
with a circular shield and armed only with a
sword, is taken from the MS. above named
(Roy. 20, C. VII.); he wears a piece of
tegulated defence, probably leather, over a
leathern jerkin, while his sleeves appear to be
of a stuffed and quilted nature, similar to a
gambeson. He has demi-plate upon the legs
and is furnished with a bascinet (<a href="#fig256">Fig. 256</a>). A soldier
is also shown wearing the high bascinet so characteristic
of the knight of the early Camail Period; it had doubtless
formed part of some loot, and the wearer added to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
the defence a large bavière which
also partially served the function of
a breastplate, while a tippet of
banded mail covers the shoulders
(<a href="#fig257">Fig. 257</a>). Some of the foot soldiers
carried a small circular shield or
buckler about 9 inches to 12 inches
in diameter and furnished with a
boss in the centre; the left hand
would be able to grasp both it and
the pike as well.</p>

<p>Towards the end
of the reign of Richard II. the fashion
of wearing a houppelande over the armour came in vogue
both for knights and common soldiery, thus
preventing the armour from being seen, except
the lower parts of the legs (see <a href="#fig258">Fig. 258</a>). With
this incongruous habit appeared also the snout-faced
or pig-faced visor of alarming proportions,
serving as a visor, gorget, and pectoral
combined. The annexed cut is taken from a
group of combatants in Roy MS. 20, C. VII.,
who are all defended in the same ungainly
manner. With the advent of the reign of
King Henry IV. this visor became of less size
and different shape, while reinforcements to
the bascinet were added to compensate. In
<a href="#fig259">Fig. 259</a>, from Roy. MS. 15, D. III., a
soldier is shown with bascinet and neck-guard
affixed; to protect the throat an
extra plate is used swinging upon pivots on either side
of the helmet&mdash;a crude bavière. Another foot soldier is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
shown with a similar defence (<a href="#fig260">Fig. 260</a>), but his bascinet is
globular at the top and furnished with a projecting neck-guard,
in which we cannot fail to see the salade in its early
stage. We may refer this to the reign of Henry V., as well
as that shown in <a href="#fig259">Fig. 259</a>. Another bascinet of the same
period is given in <a href="#fig262">Fig. 262</a>, where the small holes for fixing
the lining are shown, and also those round the lower edge
and opening for the face, for the camail. This bascinet still
further suggests the salade, as does also the one in the
British Museum (<a href="#fig263">Fig. 263</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span><i>The Archer.</i>&mdash;The equipment of the archer was
essentially of a lighter nature than that of the billman.
A pot-de-fer upon the head, with coif-de-mailles
or camail; a brigandine or jacque
of pourpointerie, covering at times a small
plastron-de-fer; upon the left arm a bracer,
otherwise legs and arms in cloth stockings
and sleeves; a girdle with axe, sword, or
scimitar depending therefrom; a quiver at
the right hip with its burden of goose-or
pigeon-feathered arrows, and the long yellow bow slung at
the back in company with a small round target&mdash;such was
the war dress of the mediæval bowman.
At times a stake sharpened
at both ends was carried to hinder
a charge of cavalry, but this was
generally improvised upon the spot.
In Roy. MS. 14, E. IV., the quivers
at this period are shown to be of
an elongated bag form, and quite
different to the late fifteenth-century
style. A very favourite weapon with
archers, judging by the number of men represented wearing
it in all MSS. of the time, is the scimitar, which is invariably
of the shape shown in <a href="#fig264">Fig. 264</a>. The curious
guard for the fingers, springing from the pommel, is very
characteristic.</p>

<a href="#fig265">Fig. 265</a>. No. 1 is shown in use by a soldier whose left
hand is guarded by the circular projection, which, together
with the long point, was made of steel. The shaft of this
formidable pike or partisan was about five feet in length,
the point three feet, and it depended for its efficacy upon
its armour-piercing qualities. Nos. 2, 5, 7 are the pole-axe
with varying modifications, the total length, including
shaft, being about eight feet; it was apparently a
favourite weapon, and is many times represented, No. 5,
the bardiche, however, being somewhat uncommon. Nos.
3 and 4 are simple forms of pikes, with a cross-guard in
one case, and an armour-piercing spike in the other. No.
6 is the deadly fauchard, a variety of the guisarme, evolved
originally from the scythe; it was a common weapon in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
Middle Ages, but inflicted such ghastly wounds with its
razor-like edges back and front, that its use in Christian
warfare was often deplored. Its total length was usually
about eight feet.</p>

<p>The antiquary, John Rouse, of Warwick, has left us
some excellent drawings of military equipment of the
fifteenth century, which are preserved in the Cottonian
MS., Julius, E. IV. They illustrate the romantic adventures
of Richard de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, and
one of these spirited sketches is introduced here (<a href="#fig266">Fig. 266</a>).
It represents a combat with pole-axes between the earl and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
Sir Pandulf Malacat at Verona, when Sir Pandulf was
badly wounded upon the left shoulder, and would probably
have fared worse had not the combat been stopped. We
gain an excellent idea from this sketch of the mode in
which the gorget was adjusted, which is difficult to realise
from a brass. The misericorde is suspended as in the later
days of Richard II., and a central prolongation of the front
taces is represented, which occurs upon several English
brasses. The shape and character of the formidable
weapons are well delineated in the sketch.</p>

Church, Norfolk.</p>
</div>

<p>The sources of information for this period are considerably
enlarged when compared with those preceding it, as, in
addition to MSS., missals, brasses, and monumental
effigies we may add paintings by the old masters, crude
woodcuts following upon the introduction of printing, and,
what is of still greater value, actual examples of arms
and armour in our public and private museums, churches,
&amp;c. The fifteenth century probably saw a greater output
of armour than any other in English history: the stirring
times in France under the Duke of Bedford and other
leaders at the end of the Hundred Years’ War was
followed almost immediately by the thirty years of intestine
strife of the Wars of the Roses. Under the stress
of these conditions armour continued to improve in defensive
power until, in the reign of Richard III. and the
earlier part of that of Henry VII., it attained to its maximum
stage of efficiency in England. In the combat
during this century between the forgers of weapons of
offence and the armour with which to resist them we have
the greatest struggle ever witnessed in this country; so
invulnerable did the plate become by completeness of
covering and dexterity in tempering that all the efforts
of the bowyer, fletcher, weapon-forger, and gunsmith had
to be enlisted to break down the solidarity of the defence,
and it was not until the succeeding century that the victor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>y
could be fairly claimed for the attacking
faction. The Tabard Period witnessed
every device in armour that the wit of
man could evolve, and it was produced
under those circumstances which would
best achieve the desired result, namely
the stress of urgent need. The name
by which this age is known, that of the
Tabard Period, has been selected by
reason of the tabard being practically
the only distinguishing feature which did
not change, and was fairly persistent
throughout. It is also used in contradistinction
to the preceding Surcoatless
Period. The tabard was a surcoat which
was generally long in the body (to mid-thigh),
and had sleeves to the elbow in the
earlier portion of its existence; but in the later period
the sleeves were much shortened,
and the tabard at times only
reached to the waist. It was
split upon both sides, and the
front and back portions fastened
together by points, drawn closely
together or left wide apart to
show the armour beneath; occasionally
no points whatever were
used, and the front and back
hung loosely from the shoulders.
It served as a protection against sun and rain, and also
as a means of personal adornment, being generally emblaz<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>oned
upon the body and also
on the sleeves with the armorial
bearings of the wearer. It was
of silk or other material, sometimes
padded so as to hang stiffly;
in most examples it depends in
folds. An early brass showing
this feature is that of William
Fynderne, 1444, at Childrey in
Berkshire (<a href="#fig267">Fig. 267</a>), where the
armorial bearings are depicted
upon the body and sleeves, both
of which are long. An early
tabard is that shown upon the
brass of Sir Ralph Shelton, 1423,
in Great Snoring Church (<a href="#fig268">Fig.
268</a>), which fits tightly to the
figure, and the tincture of the
body of the tabard has apparently
been attempted by the engraver.
Another early example is that
of John Wantele, 1424, at Amberley
Church, Sussex, where
the arms are shown upon the
body (which reaches almost
to the knees) but not on the
sleeves. Later examples are
those of Sir John Say, 1473, at
Broxbourne, Herts, and Piers
Gerard, 1492, Winwick, Lancs. In the Roy. MS. 18,
E. V., is a very spirited drawing of Julius Cæsar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span> crossing
the Rubicon, in which he is represented as wearing a tabard.
A very elaborate example, <i>c.</i> 1500, is on
the brass in Ormskirk Church, Lancashire,
commemorating a former member
of the Scarisbrick family (<a href="#fig269">Fig. 269</a>).
The figure in question wears sabbatons.</p>

<p><i>The Helmet.</i>&mdash;During the earlier
part of the Tabard Period, until about
1450, the helmet differed but slightly
from those shown in the Surcoatless,
the modifications being chiefly in the
form of the apex and the addition of a
close-fitting visor. In the example shown (<a href="#fig270">Fig. 270</a>) the visor
was probably rapidly adjusted
to the lower studs in time of
danger, or the heaume could be
worn. The shape of the apex
should be noted, and this feature
is also somewhat similar in the
helmet of John, Duke of Somerset,
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1444. In those cases
where the knight trusted to the
bascinet only, the bavière is raised
considerably to guard the face.
This is well seen in the brass
of Sir Humphrey Stafford, 1450
(<a href="#fig271">Fig. 271</a>), where the orle is a prominent
feature. An example is
given here of a brass of a later period exhibiting armour of
an earlier date, an occurrence which at times causes confusion.
Sir John de Harpedon’s brass (<a href="#fig272">Fig. 272</a>) is well known in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
Westminster Abbey, and dates from 1457; the armour is
most unusually simple for that period, and could well be
attributed to thirty years earlier,
except in regard to the gauntlets.
There are no less than eleven lames
in the taces.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 273.&mdash;Chapelle-de-fer,
<i>c.</i> 1485.</p>
</div>

<p>About 1450 the Salade (Germ.
<i>schallern</i>, from <i>schale</i>, a shell, or Italian
<i>celata</i>) was introduced into England,
and for a considerable time formed the
headpiece of knights, men-at-arms, and
archers. It rested entirely upon the
head, and was not affixed in any way
to the body armour. Its coolness was
a great recommendation, as was also
the facility with which the head could
be moved in all directions. There
appear to be two distinct head-pieces
from which the salade could owe its
development; the chapelle-de-fer is
one, and it probably suggested the
German shape. This was in use from
the thirteenth to the fifteenth centuries,
and consisted of a light iron
headpiece with a flat broad brim turned
down. In the earlier examples the brim projects equally
all round, but later it is much flatter at the front than at
the back, where it was drawn out to a point (see <a href="#fig273">Fig. 273</a>).
The Italian <i>celata</i> was the second model from which the
salade could trace its evolution; it was the helmet of
barbute form referred to on p. <a href="#Page_173">173</a>, and which was undo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>ubtedly
founded upon the Greek model. It gradually
developed in the fifteenth century into the shape shown
in <a href="#fig274">Fig. 274</a>, losing its pointed apex and
swelling outwards at the back of the neck.
Upon their introduction into France, both
German and Italian forms were classed
under the name Salade. The salade in its
primitive form was a head protection forged
at first out of one piece of metal (<a href="#fig275">Fig. 275</a> and <a href="#fig276">Fig. 276</a>)
with a comb upon the crest and an occularium, which was
made available by pulling down the front of the helmet until
it rested level with the eyes. This was superseded by one
having a movable visor which could be raised or lowered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
at pleasure, and generally when lowered was locked with
a spring catch (<a href="#fig277">Fig. 277</a>). A few examples occur in
which the long projection at the back is jointed after
the form of the lobster’s tail, and at times the salade
measured as much as sixteen or eighteen inches from
front to back. An example weighing 5 lbs. is in Case
25 at the Tower of London, dating from 1450: it is of
German make and still bright, though
much pitted all over (<a href="#fig278">Fig. 278</a>). A very
interesting example is <a href="#fig279">Fig. 279</a>, in the
Wallace Collection, dating from about
1460, which was probably used by a
mounted archer. As in the Tower example,
it is bright but pitted: the crown
is without a ridge, but becomes combed at
the tail; the form of the salade enables it
to be thrown well back upon the head when not in use. The
small holes round the visor were probably intended for the
sewing in of a lining, and the pairs of holes at the sides
show where the strong lining was affixed which supported
the helmet itself. Salades of this shape are shown in contemporary
paintings, those of Albert Dürer for example.
The mentonnière was habitually used with the salade: it
was a plate fastened by one, two, or three screws or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
almayne (sliding) rivets to the upper part of the breastplate,
and was moulded so as to cover the lower part
of the face to the lips or nose and reach to the ears on
both sides (see <a href="#fig280">Fig. 280</a>). In use the visor of the salade
when lowered fell outside the mentonnière, thus effectually
protecting the face of the wearer. A plate cheek-guard
or bavière was worn at times, and this reinforcement is
plainly seen in the salade, with crest, of the Duke Ludwig of
Bavaria, 1449 (<a href="#fig281">Fig. 281</a>). A salade of German pattern with
a very high crown is shown in <a href="#fig282">Fig. 282</a>; the general type<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
of armour prevailing upon the Continent in 1450 is here
presented, the laminated brassarts being a special feature.
As a rule, however, a collar or standard of mail was deemed
to be a sufficient protection under the mentonnière. An
example of the mentonnière dating from about 1480 is
No. 840 in the Wallace Collection; it has two plates, of
which the upper one is held in position by a spring catch;
it suggests the falling bufe of a later period. <a href="#fig283">Fig. 283</a>
represents a salade of the end of the fifteenth century; it
will be seen that a comb runs over the crown, and that
a sliding neck-guard is used in place of a rigid tail. A
magnificent example of Milanese workmanship is shown on
<a href="#plate7">Plate VII.*</a>, p. <a href="#Page_60">60</a>.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p><i>The Armet.</i>&mdash;Towards the end of the Tabard Period
the armet was introduced into England, and partially
superseded the salade and other forms of head-protection.
The origin of this helmet and the derivation of the name
are equally involved in obscurity; but it probably first saw
the light in Italy, and gradually spread through Germany
into England. “Armet” may be derived from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span> “elmetto”
or “armetto,” little helm, or “heaumet,” the diminutive
of “heaume.” The essential difference between the armet
and all those head-pieces which antedated it was that,
while the older styles had been put on by lowering them
over the head and the weight had in nearly all cases been
borne by the head, the armet opened out in its lower part
upon hinges, and could thus be closed round the head and
neck, while the weight was transferred to the gorget and
thence to the shoulders. It was in all
respects neater, lighter, and handier than
either the salade or the bascinet, while
providing a fine defensive form for both
head and neck. The armets, like the bascinets,
had in their earlier stages a camail
attached by a row of vervelles (<a href="#fig284">Fig. 284</a>)
and a reinforcing piece upon the forehead.
The same pin and hinge arrangement peculiar to the bascinet
is used for affixing the visor, which latter, by falling,
secures the opening of the helmet in front, at the same time
forming the occularium by leaving a space between its upper
edge and the lower edge of the reinforcement covering the
forehead. Under the hinges or pivots of the visor are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
upper parts of the two chin-pieces, hinged to the crown,
which overlap in front and are strapped together at the
chin. At the back occurs a tailpiece from which projects
a short stem to which is attached a flat disc, probably to
protect the back of the helmet, which was its weakest part.
An example in the Wallace Collection (<a href="#fig285">Fig. 285</a>), dating
from 1470, has the stem remaining but not the roundel,
while the holes for attaching the camail are well seen.
The pivots for the visor are in the reinforcement in this
case. Another armet from the same collection has the
pointed visor and bavière in one plate, while the roundel
is shown at the back (<a href="#fig286">Fig. 286</a>), and the latter example
shows the camail superseded by the laminated gorget with
which the armet articulated. <a href="#fig287">Fig. 287</a> also has the
disc in position; it dates from 1480, is without any reinforcing
piece upon the forehead, and the occularium is
contained in the visor. No. 46 suit of armour in the
Wallace Collection has an armet dating probably from
1490, with pointed visor and bavière in one piece; the
neck portion is furnished with a hollow roping running
round it, which fits upon and grips the upper lame of the
gorget, which being perfectly circular, like the neck of the
gorget, allows the head to be turned right and left. This was
a feature of the close helmets of the succeeding century.</p>

(Tower of London.)</p>
</div>

<p><i>Body Armour; the Breastplate.</i>&mdash;The breastplate from
approximately 1430 to 1450 remained of the same globular
form which had characterised it in the Surcoatless Period,
but after that date we often find it reinforced by another
plate, called a demi-placcate, springing upwards from the
waist, the upper part as a rule being moulded into a
graceful system of cusps.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
In some cases, a second reinforcing
plate is added over
the first, but it is doubtful
if these plates reached to
the waist in any single case.
By the system of introducing
almayne rivets the breastplate
could be given a certain
amount of mobility, and
adapt itself to the movements
of the wearer. The
goussets at the arm-holes
were ridged or roped and
sometimes turned back upon
the breastplate. The backplates,
also, about 1450, were
made in several pieces, in
order to obtain freedom of
movement; the well-known
<i>cap-à-pie</i> suit (<a href="#fig316">Fig. 316</a>) in
the Wallace Collection has
no less than five pieces in the
backplate. Towards the end
of the century, the breastplate
was reinforced with
goussets of plate adapted to
the movement of the arms
by judiciously-placed rivets.
This is shown in <a href="#fig289">Fig. 289</a>;
in the Tower Collection,
<i>c.</i> 1490 or 1500, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>in Case 48; it shows a roped border in
the upper part, holes for affixing the lance-rest, one in the
centre for the screw of the gorget
or mentonnière, and an articulated
lame of the taces at the lower
part. The section is shown with
it. The suit of armour, No. 10
in the Wallace Collection, has
the breastplate fitted with plate
goussets; it dates from 1470.
A demi-placcate of one plate is
well delineated in <a href="#fig291">Fig. 291</a> from Roy. MS.
18, E. V., 1473, being a portion of the
defence of “Goliath of Gath” in that

<p><i>Arm Defences.</i>&mdash;These were of great
variety and, as the century progressed, of
the most original and complicated description,
giving to this period the most characteristic
forms by which it can be identified.
Soon after 1440, and perhaps before that
time, the defences of the right and left
arms in England began to be of different
construction, similar to changes which
had already become well advanced upon
the Continent in the same direction.
The right arm was encased in steel
which, compared with other portions,
was comparatively thin, light, and capable
of the greatest flexibility and mobility; this was occasioned
by the need of extreme quickness of sword-play
in combat after the lance had been shivered in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span> the charge.
Laminated epaulières and laminated brassarts were accordingly
lavishly used upon the right arm as affording the
maximum amount of movement, these being strengthened
by a few extra defences of plate adapted so that they
would not hinder the flexibility so obtained. A brass at
Swaffham, 1470, illustrates the use of lames upon the right
arm (<a href="#fig292">Fig. 292</a>). The left or bridle arm, on the contrary,
was guarded by extra strong and thick plate defences and
reinforcements of all descriptions, shapes, and sizes; in
fact the general idea was to render the whole of the left
side of the knight impenetrable to the weapons then in use.
Probably this was occasioned by the partial or total disuse
of the shield in warfare, as being an encumbrance whose disadvantages
more than counterbalanced any possible benefits
which might have been derived from it. It can be readily
seen that in combat with an ordinary right-handed swordsman
the left side of the body would be liable to receive more
hurts, both in number and intensity, than the right, hence this
extraordinary strengthening of the defences upon that side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span><i>Pauldrons.</i>&mdash;The defence known as the Pauldron was
introduced in England about 1430, and may
be looked upon as a development of the
palette, which, becoming larger and larger,
finally ended by covering the epaulières.
This enlargement may be readily seen from
the accompanying <a href="#fig294">Fig. 294</a>, where the
palette is seen to have reached the shoulder.
The right arm defences of Walter, Lord
Hungerford, 1459, from his effigy in Salisbury
Cathedral (<a href="#fig295">Fig. 295</a>), afford us an
example of the pauldron in its early stage;
it is plain and of small proportions, just
sufficient to fit upon the lames beneath.
The peculiar shape of the coudière with its
flutings should be noticed. A pauldron consisting
of long lames of plate is shown in
Cott. MS., Julius, E. IV. (<a href="#fig296">Fig. 296</a>), and also
on the Staunton brass; it, however, invariably
consisted of a strong and rigid plate,
which is well exemplified in the brass of Sir
Miles Stapleton in Ingham Church, Norfolk,
1466 (<a href="#fig297">Fig. 297</a>), where the defence, beautifully
ornamented by curves and cusps, is
not only designed as a protection to the
shoulder and upper arm but also to a certain
extent for the neck, which is also encircled
by a standard of interlinked chain mail. In
this ridging for neck defence occurred the
first idea of passe-gardes or pike-guards, an
innovation which in different forms was in vogue during
the latter part of the fifteenth and nearly the whole o<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>f
the sixteenth centuries. It is still further indicated in
the brass to Thomas Colt, Armiger, 1475 (<a href="#fig298">Fig. 298</a>), at
Roydon, Essex, where a serrated ridge is shown traversing
a large part of the pauldron with the evident object
of arresting a sword-cut. The pauldron is of large dimensions,
and projects well over the breastplate. William
Yelverton, 1481, whose brass is shown at Rougham
in Norfolk, has the passe-garde well developed and rising
in a high ridge on the left side of the neck; the pauldron
is of fair dimensions, but strange to note does not cover the
left gousset (<a href="#fig299">Fig. 299</a>). It is probable that the wearer bore
a shield. The pauldron and its passe-garde or pike-guard is
well shown upon a suit of Gothic armour in the Wallace
Collection, dating from about 1490 (<a href="#fig300">Fig. 300</a>); here the
great difference in the sizes of the two pauldrons is shown,
the small one upon the right shoulder necessitating a palette
in the form of a roundel being introduced to guard the
gousset of the right arm.</p>

<p><i>The Coudières.</i>&mdash;Until about 1450 the coudières were
of normal sizes and proportions, but when the shield was
discarded and the left side of the knight was strengthen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>ed,
the left coudière became of supreme importance in the
warding off of a blow, and hence underwent changes
which in some cases can only be termed monstrous
and extravagant. Probably the brass of Sir Robert
Staunton, 1458, in Castle Donington Church, Leicestershire,
furnishes the maximum example of immensity
in coudières, though the peculiarity
of having both of the same
size and pattern should not be
overlooked. Another and later
brass, that of Thomas Playters,
1479, in Sollerley Church, shows
a coudière of a peculiar shape and
of great size, reproduced in <a href="#fig301">Fig.
301</a>. A secondary defence was
introduced about the middle of
the century to protect the inside
bend of the left arm, called the
garde-de-bras, well seen upon the brass of Sir John Peryent
the younger, 1450, at Digswell, Herts (<a href="#fig302">Fig. 302</a>); in
the accompanying <a href="#fig303">Fig. 303</a> is shown an example of a left
coudière from the Wallace Collection (No. 46), dating from
about 1490.</p>

</div>

<p><i>The Taces, Tuilles, and Tuillettes.</i>&mdash;The taces introduced
into armour during the Surcoatless Period reached approximately
to the mid-thigh of the wearer, and during that period
short lames were attached in front at times, making the skirt
of plate even longer. As the Tabard Period progressed,
however, the taces showed a tendency to decrease in number,
thereby shortening the skirt of plate and permitting more
of the thigh to be uncovered. In order to remedy this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
separate plates, rounded so as to encircle the limb to a certain
extent, were affixed to the lowermost tace by straps in front
of each thigh, and as the taces contracted
the “tuilles,” as they were termed, grew
longer and broader. An excellent example
is that of Henry Parice in Hildersham
Church, Cambridgeshire, 1465 (<a href="#fig304">Fig.
304</a>), who has tuilles, genouillières, and
elbow-pieces of extravagant size; the
tuilles are here shown suspended by straps
to the lowermost of three taces. Incidentally
the skirt of the gambeson is disclosed
in this figure, and apparently the
edge of some defence of mail worn under
the taces. A precisely similar example
occurs at Roydon, Essex, upon the brass
of Robert Colt, 1475. Towards the end
of the century the taces had so far contracted
that they reached only to the hips,
as shown in the brass of Sir Anthony de
Grey, 1480, in St. Albans Abbey Church
(<a href="#fig326">Fig. 326</a>), but another mode was sometimes
adopted, as seen in the brass of Sir
Robert Harcourt at Stanton Harcourt,
Oxfordshire (<a href="#fig305">Fig. 305</a>), where the tuille was not attached
to the lowest tace but to a higher one, the intermediate
space being filled up with short lames and mail.
Other smaller plates were at times added to protect the
outer part of the thighs, called “tuillettes.” If the front
tuilles are themselves composed of several plates, or
jointed, then the term “tuillette” is also applied to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
them.</p>

<p><i>Leg Defences.</i>&mdash;These did not undergo such decided
transformations as the remaining portions of
the armour, but a few innovations deserve
attention. Until 1450 there was no decided
change from the style prevailing in the Surcoatless
Period, with perhaps the exception
that the reinforcing plate of the genouillière
protecting the grevière had a tendency to
lengthen, but was still cut off square. After
the above date we find that it is generally
pointed in the lower
part and laminated,
while reinforcing plates
begin to appear above
the genouillière protecting
the thigh and
often overlapping each
other. An unusual reinforcement
for the
genouillière is shown
in <a href="#fig306">Fig. 306</a>; it is of
chain mail and occurs
upon a suit in the Wallace Collection
dated 1470. The actual cap covering
the knee did not undergo much change,
except that it was often prominent
and ridged, but one innovation, and a
marked one, is exhibited upon a few brasses (in the Grey
brass, St. Albans, for example), where the usual outer
guard is prolonged round the back of the knee in order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
to protect the gousset generally shown there. A peculiar
variety of genouillière is delineated in <a href="#fig307">Fig. 307</a>, where a
spike is seen projecting from the guard, and a considerable
number of lames and reinforcements are shown. It is
difficult to see the possible use of this spike, and one can
only suppose that it was so placed to annoy the horse of
an antagonist when at close quarters. It is from Roy.
MS. 18, E. IV. The sollerets remain pointed, and were
often of extravagant length, but with less lames as a rule
than in the early part of the century; towards the end,
about 1490, they disappeared and became extinct, the

<p><i>Tilting Armour.</i>&mdash;From the very earliest times since
man bore arms he has engaged in friendly contest with
others, not only as a means of recreation and engendering
mutual respect, but it was readily recognised that the
only way to obtain skill in deadly combat was to constantly
practise the art of war in the time of peace. It was also
natural and proper that these friendly combats should be
governed by rules and regulations whereby the minimum of
risk should be run, and so avoid the possibility of turning
a manly pastime from a source of enjoyment into a combat
of deadly earnestness. Although history records that the
latter result really occurred at times, it was the exception
that proved the rule, and tilting was part and parcel of a
knight’s everyday life, and the glories of the tournament
the hoped-for goal. During the early part of the Middle
Ages single encounters, and also the mêlée, were fought
in the usual harness which the knight was in the habit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
of wearing in battle, and no other precautions were taken
excepting the use of blunted spears and restricting the use
of the sword to the edge only. As time advanced, however,
and armour became heavier and more cumbersome,
the being hurled out of the saddle by a dexterous thrust
of an opponent’s lance was a matter of moment, seriously
endangering life and limb, whereas it had formerly been
deemed comparatively trivial when the defences were of
mail or textile fabrics. Hence as time progressed it became
necessary to have special armour for the tilt, or to
add such extra defences to the fighting armour that the
increased weight promised security in the saddle, and the
multiplicity of plates between himself and the weapons
of his opponent practically guaranteed immunity from
harm. This idea, once established, eventually led to the
result that a knight armed for the joust could not mount
to the saddle, but had prominent portions of this armour
fitted when mounted. He became an apparently impregnable
tower of steel, immovably fixed in a huge saddle.
The student of armour must carefully discriminate between
these tilting suits and actual war harness; the former
were never used upon the field of battle, although at
times we know that certain of the tilt defences were
borrowed in order to reinforce the usual harness. The
fifteenth century witnessed the inception and almost the
culmination of the idea, and a few of the tilting suits of
the latter part of that era are still extant. <a href="#fig310">Fig. 310</a> represents
the upper portion of a suit of tilting armour from
the collection in the Museum in Vienna; it dates from
1480, and is eminently typical of the period. The half-suit,
No. 21 (<a href="#fig418">Fig. 418</a>) in the Wallace Collection, is very similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
to the suit illustrated. The great tilting heaume is composed
of three plates of varying thickness, ranging from
nearly half an inch in the principal portions of the front
to an eighth of an inch in the back. A comb, convex in
section, runs down the centre of the crown, and radiating
flutings are seen to ornament the back. The neck of the
heaume is firmly fixed to the backplate, and three screws
serve the same purpose in front for the breastplate. The
occularium, formed by the aperture between the crown
plate and the front, appears somewhat large when seen in
this position, but remembering that the lance is held co<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>nsiderably
lower than the heaume it is possible that an
opening half an inch or even less would be presented to
it. It was quite possible to have comparative freedom of
movement for the head inside
the heaume, which was invariably
furnished with a quilted
lining.</p>

</div>

<p>The specimen in the
Wallace Collection weighs
twenty pounds. The breastplate is globular in form,
and flattened upon the right side to allow of the queue
(<a href="#fig311">Fig. 311</a>) being affixed; this singular addition consists of
a bar of steel rectangular in section and screwed firmly
into the breastplate, bearing at the rear extremity a
turned down hook which resisted the upward pressure of
the butt of the lance. The front portion of the queue
has another hook turned upwards, in which the lance
rested, and behind which it was gripped by the hand.
This hook was omitted when the lance-rest was separate
and affixed to the right side of the breastplate, as seen
in the figure, where it appears to be forged in one piece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
and secured by two screws. An excellent example demonstrating
in a practical manner the use of the queue
is exhibited in the Tower Collection, where the lance is
seen in position, and a large vamplate of curious design
is affixed for the protection of the hand and arm (see
<a href="#fig312">Fig. 312</a>). In order to admit of the free passage of the
lance the large palette protecting the right armpit is
slightly hollowed at its lowest part; the Wallace suit has
a companion palette protecting the left arm. Upon the
shoulders are pauldrons of two plates, decorated with
radiating fluting, and upon these in the Wallace suit are
two upright iron pins or projections to which were attached
the flowing ends of the lambrequin, contoise, or
mantling, depending from the crest. In the example from
Vienna eyelets occur upon the pauldrons for the same
purpose. The brassarts are laminated and overlap each
other downwards. Upon the right arm appears the Polder
mitten (a corruption of <i>épaule de mouton</i>, so named from
its shape), an additional reinforcing piece which is screwed
to the vambrace and protects a large portion of the
arm. It has fine flutings radiating from the bend. No
gauntlet is seen, the vamplate generally affording a sufficient
protection for the hand. A similar reinforcement for
the right arm is upon the Wallace suit, which differs only
in a few details, whilst a very fine example of this reinforcement,
but dating from a later period, is preserved in the
Tower (No. 371, Case 25) (<a href="#fig313">Fig. 313</a>), which exhibits excellent
workmanship. The elbow-joint of the left arm is protected
by a <i>garde-de-bras</i> similar in form to that upon the
right arm; this is riveted to a manifere (or <i>main-de-fer</i>) of
one plate protecting the bridle hand, and decorated with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
flutings radiating from the wrist. The protection for the
left arm in the Wallace suit is represented in <a href="#fig314">Fig. 314</a>; it is
a large and finely fluted piece secured to the vamplate by
three screws. A small oak shield covered with leather
and painted is secured by a guige passing through two
holes in the left upper part of the breastplate; it is not
connected in any way with the arm,
but simply hangs in position. This is
the Stechtarsche. In <a href="#fig310">Fig. 310</a>, no
armour is shown below the waist, but
the Wallace suit is furnished with taces
of four plates, to the lowest of which
are fixed the tuilles; while the breastplate
is reinforced by a placcate. Judging
from the deep grooves and indentations
upon the heaume and palettes
this suit has been donned at times in
the combat <i>à outrance</i>, when the war
spear was employed, as the lance-head
or coronal customarily used in the Joustes of Peace would
not effect such damage. The Joustes in question were
conducted upon the original methods, namely, in the open
lists or field and without any obstruction between the
combatants; the system of running with a barrier between
the horses was termed the Italian course, and was not used
generally in Europe until the sixteenth century. This
Italian course is known as <i>Über die Pallia</i> (over the
barriers), or <i>Welsches Gestech</i>, in contradistinction to the
open course or <i>Das Deutsche Stechen</i>. The Wallace suit,
including the heaume, weighs 96 lbs., and bears the Augsburg
guild mark. A few extra tilting pieces which came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
into vogue upon the Continent in this period will be dealt
with in a subsequent chapter.</p>

<p>A fine suit of Gothic armour to which reference has
been previously made is in the Wallace Collection (<a href="#fig288">Fig.
288</a>) which dates from 1470. The salade is of fine covering
form and is fitted with a lifting visor; the mentonnière has
one plate which falls if required. The breastplate is reinforced
with a large placcate and has laminated goussets protected
by fluted roundels. The taces are of three plates,
to which the tuillettes (so called because they consist of
more than one plate) are suspended. Espalier pauldrons
of very fine workmanship protect the shoulders and upper
arms; the coudières are peculiar to the period, while mitten
gauntlets with long cuffs and demi-vambraces are also
used. Demi-cuissarts of three plates have the genouillières
fixed to them, while the jambarts are complete. The
sollerets and a few other parts of the suit are restorations.
The chain-mail reinforcements to the jambarts are of rare
occurrence.</p>

</div>

<p>A suit of armour in the Tower of London deserves
special mention by reason of its being the oldest <i>cap-à-pie</i>
suit of plate in the collection. It is shown in <a href="#fig315">Fig. 315</a>, and
probably dates from the middle of the fifteenth century,
having practically no decorations of any importance. It is
furnished with a visorless salade having a long tailpiece,
and a gorget with a roped border which is probably of a
later date. The epaulières consist of five laminated plates;
the coudières are small, while demi-brassarts and complete
vambraces cover the upper and lower arms respectively.
The gauntlets are of overlapping plates with large cuffs.
The breastplate has two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
demi-placcates reinforcing it,
and the backplate is of three
pieces. The taces are three
in number, to which tuilles
of one plate are affixed.
Demi-cuissarts, plain small
genouillières with fan-shaped
guards, and grevières of
complete plate (probably
recent) protect the lower
limbs. There are no sollerets.
The figure is equipped with
a pole-axe of an original
pattern, the shaft being
partially sheathed in iron.
Another suit, No. 26, probably
dates from the last
years of the fifteenth century,
as it is furnished with a
chain-mail skirt. The
breastplate has a demi-placcate
strengthening it; the
gauntlets are very elaborate
with fine gadlyngs and cuffs
(probably the cuffs only are
original); the cuissarts have
four lames upon the upper
parts, while the sollerets are
of beautiful construction but
recent workmanship. The
backplate is of two plates, and a garde-de-rein is affixed
below. The suit has been much restored.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>The finest example of complete war harness for man and
horse to be seen in London, and probably in England, of
the very early period of 1460 is that which occupies such a
prominent position in the Wallace Collection (<a href="#fig316">Fig. 316</a>).
It was formerly in the famous collection of the Count de
Nieuwerkerke, who purchased it from M. E. Juste, of Paris,
for £1200, but probably if it came under the hammer now
it would bring in four to six times that sum. As one might
expect, it has had to be made up in a few parts to its
present complete condition, but nothing whatever has been
done to the armour for the lower limbs, which is original
and well preserved. This is the more to be wondered at
inasmuch as those are the parts more liable to suffer injury
and need replacement than any others. The salade is of
fine form and furnished with a visor, the occularium being
formed between the upper part of the visor and the lower
edge of the crown-piece. The mentonnière is attached by a
screw to the breastplate, and is in two parts, the upper one
falling if required, similar to the buffe of a later period,
while a demi-placcate is affixed by an almayne rivet to reinforce
the breastplate. The backplate is in five plates, all
riveted in such a manner as to afford the maximum of
movement for the back. A garde-de-rein of four plates
is affixed below. The left coudière is of a graceful form
and large proportions; the right differs in pattern, and
has a garde-de-bras riveted to the vambrace protecting the
inner bend of the arm. The cuissarts, composed of a
number of plates, are of a most ingenious design, whereby
tuilles are rendered superfluous. But perhaps the chief
point of interest is centred in the sollerets, which ha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>ve
extreme lengths of pointed toe-caps; to these are attached
the spurs, the necks of which are ten inches in length. At
a period when it was necessary to cut the straps of sollerets
when fighting on foot, and so remove the projecting point as
to enable the knight to walk, it is curious to find in this suit
that no provision is made for such a contingency, and that
the long, pointed toe is riveted on. The genouillières are of
latten, and below them deep pointed plates extend, to which
are affixed the grevières, which fasten by spring catches on
the inside. The whole of the armour is of a most graceful
form, and the eye, accustomed to mediæval representations
of contemporary equipment, dwells with delight upon this
beautiful example of art from the Middle Ages. The use
of latten as a means of adornment for the edges of various
plates gives a rich contrast to the dull grey of the steel.
Another fine suit of <i>cap-à-pie</i> armour dating from the
fifteenth century, in the Wallace Collection, is No. 46,
which may be of German origin, and dates from about 1490.
The head is protected by an armet of very fine proportions,
opening down the centre of the chin-piece, and having a
bavière and visor in a single plate. The breastplate is very
globose, and is an example of the mediæval fashion of
engraving mottoes, texts, invocations to the saints, &amp;c., upon
armour, as it bears a prominent inscription. It is furnished
with sabbatons, and partakes in many characteristics of the
nature of armour of the succeeding century.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>The second half of the fifteenth century saw armour
not only in its highest development, but also of the most
beautiful form, for nothing can exceed the graceful lines
and excellence of workmanship characterising the Gothic
style, as it is usually called. It was made to fit the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>human
form and to adapt itself to the movements of the wearer.
One of the most valuable relics we possess, illustrating
its features, is the absolutely unique effigy of Richard
Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, in the Beauchamp Chapel,
St. Mary’s Church, Warwick, <i>temp.</i> 1454 (the earl died
in 1439). It is of latten, gilded, and in perfect preservation:
every feature, turn, and curve of the original
copy is faithfully reproduced not only upon the front
part or upper surface, but also upon the back; it was
turned over some time since in order to be copied, and
was found to be as carefully and accurately finished there
as in the parts usually visible. Every detail is represented
except the mentonnière, which is usually absent in effigies,
though the catch for its attachment is shown. The points
calling for special notice are the passe-guards or pike-guards
upon the pauldrons which constitute a very early
example of this adjunct, and also the presence of two
large tuilles and two smaller tuillettes. The coudières
are large and of the beautiful butterfly pattern, covering
the inner bend of the arm; they are both equal in size
and of the same pattern. Although the work was executed
by an Englishman, William Austin, the armour is
undoubtedly of Milanese manufacture, and may be ascribed
to the Missaglias. An early example, foreshadowing the
changes which occurred in defensive armour in the second
half of the fifteenth century, is that of Thomas de St.
Quintin, 1445, in Harpham Church, Yorkshire (<a href="#fig317">Fig. 317</a>).
The figure is represented in pointed bascinet and mentonnière,
beneath which the laminated epaulières are partly
visible. These are almost covered by two palettes of
singularly large size, that upon the left being the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a><br /><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>greater;
the reinforcement to the breastplate appears below. Upon
the right coudière is an additional plate
termed the garde-de-bras, and another of
larger proportions and different form
covers the left. The breastplate is of
the short form, and necessitates the addition
of six taces, to which are appended
the tuilles. The figure shows the sword
and misericorde being worn as in the
Surcoatless Period. The effigy of Sir
Richard Vernon, 1452, at Tong Church,
Shropshire, is an excellent example of
mediæval Gothic armour, and as portrayed
in “Shaw’s Dresses and Decorations”
is simply magnificent. Our <a href="#frontispiece">frontispiece</a>
is adapted from the illustration.
The orle surrounding
the bascinet is
gorgeous with chased work and pearls;
the head rests upon a ponderous
heaume, shaped for the shoulders,
and bearing crest and mantling. The
mentonnière is here in place: the
breastplate is reinforced by a demi-placcate,
and there are eight lames
of taces with short tuilles. The
genouillières have only a lower reinforcement,
and the sollerets are
comparatively short. A very late example of the hip-belt is
shown, from which the misericorde is suspended, the sword-belt
being quite distinct. The pauldrons are dissimilar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
the right being the smaller and hollowed for the lance;
while the upper parts of both are fluted. The coudières
are distinctly beautiful, with radiating flutings upon the
butterfly shape, which is folded inwards over the goussets.</p>

<p>Of the same date as the Beauchamp effigy is the well-known
brass of John Daundelyon at Margate, 1455, whose
breastplate is of the short character, as shown in the effigy;
the bascinet is very pointed at the apex, and the mentonnière
appears of singularly graceful form. The palettes
are large and dissimilar, the left covering a considerable
portion of the breastplate; upon the left arm is a circular
garde-de-bras attached to the coudière, while an extremely
large coudière is shown upon the left arm which may be
regarded as a second garde-de-bras: the gauntlets are
characterised by long pointed cuffs. Walter Green, 1450,
whose brass occurs at Hayes, Middlesex, is represented
without any bascinet, but with the head resting on a visored
tilting helm (<a href="#fig318">Fig. 318</a>). The epaulières consist of a number
of lames which extend upwards to the neck, where they
are confined by a band, and over these are two symmetrical
pauldrons of plain pattern. His armour bears a
remarkable resemblance to that of John Gaynesford, 1460,
in Crowhurst Church, Surrey, even to the plain gauntlets
of four plates covering the hands. In both examples
the taces are numerous and worked into broad escallops,
tuilles being omitted (<a href="#fig319">Fig. 319</a>). An early example of
the garde-de-bras is that represented upon the memorial
effigy of Sir John Verney, Albury, 1452, where a small
garde is attached to the coudière of the right arm and
an enlarged one of peculiar shape to the left (<a href="#fig320">Fig. 320</a>).
Upon the same effigy also occurs a complicated genouilliè<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>re,
which, fitting closely to the knee, is provided with
two reinforcements
above and below, the
extreme plates being
worked into highly
ornamental forms (<a href="#fig321">Fig.
321</a>). A coudière of
large size and graceful
form is shown upon the
brass of Henry Parice,
1464, at Hildersham,
Cambridge, where arming
points are seen
attaching it to the brassart
and vambrace: it
is serrated in the upper extension, and the same decoration
is repeated upon the pike-guard of the pauldron. In
this figure the lance-rest is shown affixed
to the breastplate (<a href="#fig322">Fig. 322</a>). Upon the
same brass there is an example of extravagant
tuilles attached to the lowest of three
taces by straps, while the rare occurrence
of the skirt of the haqueton with the
edge of a defence of mail (possibly a hauberk)
is shown, another instance being that
at Roydon, Essex, upon the brass of Robert
Colt, 1475. Sir Robert Staunton’s brass,
1458, in Castle Donington Church, Leicestershire (<a href="#fig323">Fig. 323</a>),
affords us the best example of extravagant coudières, and
is also remarkable for showing the salade, which is of extreme
rarity upon brasses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
and effigies. The latter is
represented very wide in
form, with a falling visor
having the occularium in
it, and guided by a prolongation
which apparently
runs backwards and forwards
upon a hidden comb.
The gorget is of plate, over
which the laminated epaulières
are shown, apparently
meeting over the chest:
other details of the arms
are hidden by the enormous
coudières, which, strange to
say, are of similar size and
form. They are cusped and
fluted in the upper parts.
Upon viewing these arm
defences the reason may
readily be perceived why
the knights deemed the
shield superfluous. A demi-placcate
is added to the
breastplate. The armour
shown upon the brass of Sir
Robert del Bothe, 1460, in
Wilmslow Church, Cheshire
(<a href="#fig324">Fig. 324</a>), is characterised
by excessive singularity of contour, suggesting an origin in
one of the northern continental countries. No headpiece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
is shown, but the knight probably wore the salade: a
mentonnière of several plates covers the upper part of
the breastplate, which apparently is not reinforced. The
massive pauldrons are almost similar in outline, and each
is provided with a projecting ridge upon the shoulder in
addition to a low pike-guard. The chain mail gousset
is very apparent where the pauldron has been cut away
to permit of the lance being held. The coudières are
strange, almost grotesque, in form. The right arm in
wielding the sword, mace, and lance, would be almost
always in an extended position, hence the small latitude
allowed in the coudière for bending it: the left, or
bridle arm, would necessarily be bent more. The awkward
position of the arms may be explained by stating
that on the brass the knight is holding the right hand
of his lady with his own. The long form of breastplate
necessitates only three taces, which are escalloped, and two
large tuilles, vieing in size with those of Henry Parice,
are appended. The genouillières are remarkable for
the excessive development of the guard-plate protecting
the gousset at the back of the knees; this guard is seen
upon many effigies but few brasses, and where it occurs
in the latter might easily be overlooked&mdash;see the brass
of Sir Anthony de Grey for example. Upon the brass of
Sir Thomas Grene in Grene’s Norton Church, Northamptonshire
(<a href="#fig325">Fig. 325</a>), the knee-guards are, if anything,
larger than those upon the Bothe brass, while Henry
Green, in Luffwick Church, Northamptonshire, 1467, who
wears a tabard, has similar guards. Sir Robert del Bothe
is among the first, or is the first, to exemplify the wearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
of the sword in front of the body sloping from right
to left: this fashion was introduced about 1460, and is
one of the clues used in identifying the chronology of a
brass.</p>

<p>In the brass at Grene’s Norton, mentioned above,
however, a curious modification occurs;
the misericorde, which is of
huge dimensions and like an anelace
in some respects, is slung perpendicularly
in front, and the sword suspended
on the left side. The brass
of Sir John Say, 1473, at Broxbourne,
Herts, is habited in a tabard
blazoned with his armorial bearings,
and exhibits the hausse-col or standard
of mail then commonly worn round
the throat when the tilting helm
alone was used as a protection for
head and neck. The memorial brass
to Sir Anthony de Grey, 1480, in
St. Albans Abbey Church, Herts,
exemplifies the armour known as
the Richard III. style in every particular
(<a href="#fig326">Fig. 326</a>). Round the neck
is a hausse-col or standard; the head
rests upon a tilting helm, the occularium and projection beneath
it being visible over the right shoulder, while the staple
for affixing it to the breastplate appears with the mantling
over the left. The pauldrons are large, and apparently
reinforced by a secondary plate beneath; they are symmetrical
in shape and have no pike-guards. The coudières
are large and of peculiar shape while long cuffs are appended
to the shell-gauntlets. This form of pauldron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
was fairly prevalent at the time, and also during the early
part of the next century. Two demi-placcates appear upon
the breastplate: the taces are only three in number, and
short tuilles appear in front with tuillettes covering the
hips: the genouillières appear with reinforcements extending
well up the thigh and a guard-plate passes behind the
goussets. The sword is slung in the prevailing mode, but
the misericorde is in an almost horizontal position at the
back. Similar armour in its broad outlines is used upon
the figures in the Warwick Roll of John Rouse, written
and illustrated in the reign of Richard III., of which we
give examples. Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury, is
represented in a salade with an unusual knob upon the
summit (<a href="#fig327">Fig. 327</a>); the short taces and dependent tuilles
are here exemplified, as are also the shell gauntlets. The
shield with its bouche at the corner is concave to the
front, and the sword is shown with a disproportionately
short grip and much swollen, similar to that in the De
Grey brass. The figure of King Richard III. (<a href="#fig328">Fig. 328</a>)
habited in a tabard also occurs in the Roll; the coudières
are peculiarly spiked, but otherwise the armour has the
usual Yorkist characteristics.</p>

<p>Among the most interesting pieces of armour in the
British Isles we must include the Rhodes armour preserved
in the Rotunda at Woolwich. The Knights of St. John
of Jerusalem occupied Rhodes after their expulsion from
the Holy Land, and subsequently migrated to Malta. In
the early part of Queen Victoria’s reign General Sir J. H.
Lefroy was sent by the British Government to Turkey,
and while there secured the Dardanelles cannon described
elsewhere, and also the Rhodes armour, left behind by th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>e
Knights. This is one of the most valuable of late “finds,”
and the whole of it is in the Rotunda. Much is in bad
condition and would not bear cleaning, but one suit has been
made up and is illustrated in <a href="#plate9">Plate IX.</a>, p. <a href="#Page_72">72</a>. The salade
is of a very deep form with a large visor; there is a lobster-tail
neck-guard of two lames. The mentonnière is more
of the nature of a gorget, and is not affixed to the breastplate.
The pauldrons are laminated and continuous with
the brassarts, which have turners, while the coudières are
of the sixteenth century. The vambraces are late fifteenth
century, as are also the gauntlets. The breastplate is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
globose and furnished with a placcate, while the backplate
has been provided with a garde-de-rein from the Tower.
The cuissarts and genouillières are late fifteenth century,
but the jambarts are of a still later date. In order to complete
the figure a chain-mail hauberk has been lent from the
Tower, and the tuilles and sollerets have been made. The
two-handed sword is a fine example, dating from <i>c.</i> 1510.
The whole suit may be looked upon as an example of the
style prevailing <i>c.</i> 1490.</p>

<p>The period under discussion, from 1430 to 1500, saw
the common foot soldier, whether bowman, arbalestier, billman,
petardier, or cannonier, much better equipped, and in
every way more carefully provided for, than in any preceding
age. It had early been perceived in England that
the native infantry was as effective in battle as the flower
of foreign chivalry, and instead of being jealous of this fact,
as were the foreign nobles as a rule of their own foot
soldiers, the knights of our own country sought by every
possible means to add to the deadly prowess of the soldier,
and to defend him by every artifice that wit could devise.
It came to be recognised as an article of military knowledge
that a charge of cavalry against English archers
armed with the long-bow resulted, under ordinary conditions,
in disaster, and that no good result was to be
obtained by it, but on the contrary it was simply to court
destruction. The lessons of Creçy and of Poictiers had
been well learnt, and it was remembered that the French
chivalry, although encased in steel and the horses defended
by bardings, simply melted away before the deadly sleet
of arrows emanating from the English position, and in
spite of their most strenuous efforts only managed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span> reach
the archers in such a disorganised form that an effective
charge was out of the question. So long as the bowmen
stood firmly in their position and preserved order and
discipline they had nothing to fear
from the most determined charge of
cavalry. The secret of this undoubtedly
was that although the
knight himself was impervious to
the arrow so long as it did not
strike a gousset or the junction or
joint between two plates, his horse
was by no means equally well protected,
and it is well known that
the arrow was in most cases directed
towards the unfortunate steed in preference
to the invulnerable rider. It
thus became a custom for the knights
and heavily-accoutred men-at-arms
to dismount and advance on foot to
the charge, in imitation doubtless of
the example set by the Black Prince
at Poictiers. But the slow progress
of such a mass of heavily-armed men against a body of
archers gave the latter plenty of time to select their opponents,
and with unerring aim to challenge the weak points of
their adversaries’ defences with the deadly cloth-yard shaft.
The invariable result was that the archer came off victorious,
and the discomfited mail-clad knight thus found himself
unable to reach the enemy with whom he desired to close
either on horseback or on foot. In this dilemma the
invention of the pavise came to his help, and for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span> time the
archer was to a certain extent nonplussed. This was at
first an upright wicker-work defence, square
in form and plane of surface, sufficiently
large to cover the knight and also the
page or squire who bore it. The knight
also carried his own shield as an additional
defence, and thus effectually protected from
arrows could advance to close quarters, or
if necessary, take post behind his own
archers in order to repel a charge of
cavalry. The pavise, once introduced,
was quickly improved upon, and soon developed
into a convex shield of wood faced with leather
or other protective material, and resting upon the ground.
Some of these were elaborately decorated,
being painted with designs of more or less
merit, some of which have been preserved
to the present age and form remarkable
instances of mediæval art. In the Wallace
Collection is a pavise of parchment upon
a foundation of wood, with a semi-circular
ridge down the centre, upon which occurs
a representation of a castle and background.
It is of German origin, and
dates from about 1490; another in the
same museum of about the year 1500
has a similar ridge down the centre, is
of the same materials, and is painted
black. The arms of Nuremberg in colours are upon the
left-hand top corner. The examples are only sufficiently
large to cover one man, and might therefore have been us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>ed
by archers, arbalestiers, cannoniers, &amp;c., for these were alert
to seize upon the new defence, and quickly adopted it.
During the siege of a town or fortress
the pavise was in constant use, and in
MSS. of the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries it is common to note in the
illuminations how they are employed
to cover every type of combatant.
In Cotton MS., Julius, E. IV., many
examples are delineated, bodies of
pavisiers being shown in combat with
each other. <a href="#fig329">Fig. 329</a> is a representation
of a mediæval long bowman
of the year 1473, in which he is
shown with a hat and gorget of banded
mail and a hauberk of overlapping
scales of leather covered by a brigandine of leather.
The only plate defence is a corselet. The quiver is slung
at the back and a sword in front. The arbalestier
shown in <a href="#plate40">Plate XL.</a>, p. <a href="#Page_366">366</a>, is habited in a very graceful
salade, a brigandine of the fifteenth century partly
covered by demi-breast and backplates, or placcates, and
wears a knee-piece upon the left leg. The arbalestier of
the time of Edward IV. is represented in the Harleian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
MS. No. 4379 (<a href="#fig330">Fig. 330</a>) as possessing a complete defensive
equipment, consisting of bascinet, camail, brigandine
of jazeraint work, tuilles of leather plates, and complete
plate for the legs. In addition he has a
corselet of plate. The peculiarly-shaped
quiver for the bolts is characteristic of
the period. That arbalestiers were as an
established rule better provided with defences
we have already seen: a further
confirmation is afforded by the accompanying
<a href="#fig331">Fig. 331</a> of an arbalestier of
the earlier part of the fifteenth century,
before the dagged houppelande of Richard
II. and Henry IV.’s reign had gone out
of fashion: he is represented as being
clothed in it, whereby the defences of
the body and arms are hidden, but the
legs are in plate, with sollerets for the
feet, and a chapelle-de-fer, or plain skull-cap,
covers the head. It is taken from Sloane MS.
2433.</p>

<p>The chapelle-de-fer was a common headpiece
for the soldier of the fifteenth century; an example
dating from <i>c.</i> 1490 is preserved in the Tower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span> (<a href="#fig332">Fig.

round the brim for a padded lining. Another representation
is from Roy. MS. 14, E. IV. (<a href="#fig333">Fig. 333</a>), which
is simply a pot-de-fer with the addition of a turned-down
brim. The soldier also
wears a coif-de-mailles. It must not be supposed
that salades were
entirely confined to the
knightly orders; they
are seen upon horse
and foot soldiers of all
grades; three are delineated
here which
are very common, and
are represented freely
in MSS. (<a href="#fig334">Fig. 334</a>),
while others of different
forms appear in
this chapter (<a href="#fig335">Fig. 335</a>).
In MS. No. 6984 of
the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris, a work of the late fifteenth
century, a reputed knight is shown opening a door. He is
copied in <a href="#fig336">Fig. 336</a>, and is undoubtedly a leader of arquebusiers,
pikemen, or arbalestiers, and not of the knightly
order. The extra protection of a roundel at the side of the
salade was very common upon the Continent, while leather
is used for taces as in <a href="#fig330">Fig. 330</a>. The limbs are in plate,
and a corselet is shown. The tabs at the neck, shoulders,
and knees are of frequent occurrence in illuminations.</p>

<p>The petardier of the fifteenth century, who hurled small
bombs, or else pots filled with Greek fire, into the ranks
of the enemy, was also clothed in plate, sometimes from
head to heel. He was considered of great importance,
and consequently rendered as impervious as possible to
the weapons with which he might be assailed. The
thrower of the fire-pot
represented in <a href="#fig337">Fig. 337</a>
(from Roy. MS. 18, E.
V.) is protected thus,
even to roundels covering
the goussets, unless
these are mammelières,
which are of very frequent
appearance. Opposing
him is a foot
soldier wielding a bastard
sword and protecting
himself with a
small buckler; he wears
a visored salade with
camail and a gorget, a close-fitting brigandine over a
hauberk of mail, and his arms are protected by plate. As
is the case in the majority of representations of soldiers of
this period, the legs are entirely undefended. From the
same MS., which dates from 1473, we reproduce an interesting
figure (No. 338) of a hand-gun man discharging
one of the crude pieces of that period, whose picturesque
appearance it would be difficult to excel. The salade is
especially enriched with an enlargement of the customary
roundels, while two demi-placcates reinforce his breastplate,
which is probably of leather. Only genouillières<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
appear upon his legs, a system of defence which was much
in vogue at that time. A hand-gun man of 1470 is depicted
in <a href="#fig339">Fig. 339</a>. Among the mercenaries introduced
into England during the Wars of the Roses were “Burgundenses”
or Burgundian hand-gun
men. Warwick had a body
of these at the second battle of
St. Albans in 1461, and in <a href="#fig340">Fig.
340</a> we have in all probability
a representation of their accoutrement. Upon the body the
defences are a padded jacque, similar in nature of material
to the gambeson, combined with chain mail and pourpointerie.
The visor upon the salade is apparently fixed,
while the legs are encased in mail chausses covered with
demi-cuissarts and jambarts. The cannonier of the period
was usually without any defensive equipment whatever.
A small illustration is appended from the Sloane MS. No.
2433 of the fifteenth century, from which it will be per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>ceived
that he is dressed in ordinary civilian garments
(<a href="#fig341">Fig. 341</a>). It was probably deemed unnecessary to clothe
him in armour by reason of the distance which separated
him from the contest.</p>

<h3>THE TRANSITION PERIOD, 1500-1552</h3>


<p>The salient features of the Transition Period are:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The adoption of sabbatons in the place of sollerets.</p>

<p>2. The chain mail skirt.</p>

<p>3. The general use of a closed helmet.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 345 and 346.&mdash;Helmets. (Tower of London.)</p>
</div>

<p><i>The Helmet.</i>&mdash;This defence was invariably of the
“closed” pattern, and consisted of a crown with a ridge,
generally roped, down the centre; two cheek-pieces meeting
together at the chin and fastening there; the visor and
bavière formed of one piece, pierced with oblong apertures
for the occularium, and having small holes for ventilation and
breathing purposes. The bavière was a relict of the mentonnière
of a previous period, and the close helmet may be
regarded as a direct evolution from the armet; in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>deed it is
at times difficult to differentiate between the two. The
roundel at the back of the neck in the armet gave way to a
plate-guard. The neck portion of the close helmet was furnished
with a hollow rim, generally decorated with roping,
which fitted over a corresponding solid rim upon the upper
portion of the gorget and permitted the head to be rotated
from side to side. The visor and bavière in the early helmets
were in one piece, and very often of the bellows pattern, but
later examples show them in two distinct pieces, the upper
portion, or visor proper, falling down inside the bavière.</p>

<p>The helmet shown in <a href="#fig347">Fig. 347</a>, dating from 1500, opens
down the sides instead of down the chin and back like the
armet, and the same pivot which secures the visor also
serves as a hinge for the crown and chin-piece. In
<a href="#fig347">Fig. 347</a><span class="smcap">A</span> we have illustrated a German fluted helmet,
partly engraved and gilded and of good form and workmanship.
It opens down the chin. The skill shown in
the forging of the crown and the fluting of the twisted
comb is remarkable, and each rivet of the lining strap of
the cheek-pieces forms the centre of an engraved rose.
It is provided with a roped rim to fit over a solid rim on
the gorget. <a href="#fig348">Fig. 348</a> is the front view of a helmet dating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
from 1520 which differs chiefly from the last helmet in the
form of the visor, while the example shown in <a href="#fig348">Fig. 348</a><span class="smcap">A</span> is
of Italian origin and of the same period. It is small and of
an extremely graceful form. Figs.
<a href="#fig345">345</a>, <a href="#fig346">346</a>, are contemporary helmets
from the Tower of London.</p>

</div>

<p><i>The Gorget</i> of the period consisted
of laminated plates riveted at
the sides of the neck and working
freely upon each other, but covering
from below upwards. These gorgets
were an essential feature of the
following, or Maximilian, period. It often spread over the
chest and extended down the back as well; it was furnished
with sliding rivets to allow of the maximum of freedom.
At times this gorget was fixed to and formed part of the
close helmet. Towards the latter
part of the period the standard or
collar of mail appears to have been
worn very frequently to protect the
neck; in these cases one or more
lames forming a gorget were added
to the lower part of the helmet to
fit over and reinforce the standard.
An example is shown in <a href="#fig349">Fig. 349</a>.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 350.&mdash;Globose breastplate,
1510. (Tower of London.)</p>
</div>

<p><i>The Breastplate</i> was globose, and as a rule furnished
with one or more articulated lames (or taces) at the lower
part, which permitted freedom of motion for the body at
the waist. <a href="#fig350">Fig. 350</a> represents a breastplate in the Tower
which has one lame. Goussets of plate are invariably
found at the junction of the arms with the body; these
were also made to slide freely upon their rivets. At t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>he
top a projecting collar protected the part where the
gorget was covered by the breastplate,
and this feature is exemplified
in Figs. <a href="#fig350">350</a> and <a href="#fig351">351</a>, the latter also
being an example from the Tower
of London though a little later in
date. The apertures pierced in it
were made for the attachment of
various tilting pieces. The ornamentation
shown in <a href="#fig350">Fig. 350</a> consists
of mere sunken indentations,
and suggests flutings.</p>

</div>

<p><i>The Pauldrons.</i>&mdash;These became
much modified from the huge examples
characteristic of the latter
part of the Tabard Period, losing
their angular appearance and becoming
more rounded and at the same time mobile.
This was effected by making the whole pauldron of lames
of steel, generally overlapping upwards;
the upper lame was as a
rule moulded into a strong pike-guard,
sometimes upon the left
shoulder only, but generally upon
both. The lames were carried
well round to the back and front
over the goussets, and were attached
to the back- and breast-plates.
If the right gousset is exposed a roundel is generally
affixed to the pauldron. That the plate pauldrons of an
earlier date were not, however, entirely superseded is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
shown by the monumental brass of W. Bardwell, 1508,
in West Herling Church, Norfolk, where a massive
pauldron furnished with two pike-guards is shown upon
the left shoulder, and a dissimilar one of still larger proportions,
and provided with one guard, upon the other
(<a href="#fig349">Fig. 349</a>).</p>

<div class="figplate" style="width: 285px;">

<p class="caption">PLATE XXIII*</p>

<p class="caption-sub">Flemish Armour, 1624</p>

<p class="right"><i>A. F. Calvert</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>The Brassarts</i>, Vambraces, Coudières, and Gauntlets all
partake more or less of the laminated character, but the
coudières are remarkably small when compared with those
of the later Tabard Period, and furnished with large expanding
guards for the inside bend of the arm.</p>

<p><i>The Cuissarts</i>, Genouillières, and Grevières are of plate,
with rounded caps for the genouillières and a few lames for
reinforcements.</p>

<p><i>The Sabbatons.</i>&mdash;These broad-toed sollerets were introduced
during the later part of the previous period, those of
Piers Gerard (date 1492) being illustrated on p. <a href="#Page_232">232</a>. They
present many varieties of form, but are not distinguished
for extraordinary size, as they were during the Maximilian
period.</p>

<p><i>The Skirt of Mail</i> was a marked feature of the period,
and one by which it may generally be recognised. At times
it almost reached to the knees, but as a general rule it
terminated a short distance below the middle of the thigh.
It was of fine mail, and in all probability only a skirt
fastening round or below the waist. Occasionally it is
slit up a short distance back and front, in order to give
facilities for riding. The mail skirt had been growing in
favour for some time: Lord Audley, 1491, upon his brass
in Sheen Church, Surrey, exhibits it, and Edward Stafford,
Earl of Wiltshire, 1499, in Luffwick Church, Northants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
has a similar skirt, namely to mid-thigh. Perhaps the
earliest example is that of John, Lord L’Estrange, 1478,
at Hillingdon, Middlesex, who has a mail skirt to the
knees, one tuille in front and one on either side; sabbatons;
a pike-guard upon the pauldron, and guards round the
back of the knees: but all are very plain, similar to the
Stanley brass.</p>

<p>The tuilles lying upon this skirt were generally of
large proportions and suspended from the bottom tace; they
did not reach, however, so low as the hem of the skirt.
Wm. Bardwell’s brass exhibits no tuilles whatever over
the skirt of mail, and Richard Gyll, 1511, sergeant of the
bakehouse under Henry VII., shows upon his brass in
Shottisbrooke Church, Hants, two almost ludicrously small
tuilles, affixed to the lowest of four narrow taces. John
Colt, 1521, of Roy don Church, Essex, has extremely small
tuilles over his deep skirt of mail similar to the Gyll brass;
he is habited in a tabard.</p>

<p>From the foregoing it will readily be gleaned that
very important alterations occurred in armour of this period,
differentiating it from that of the preceding. The great
pauldrons, exaggerated coudières, and general angularity,
and, one might almost say prickliness, of the later Tabard
Period was modified to a smoother and rounder style,
while it lost entirely that remarkable beauty of form
which, however much distorted by fanciful additions,
characterised the Gothic armour as a whole. The beautiful
flutings and ornamental curves disappeared to make way
for a heavy, cumbersome style indicative of German stolidity,
and in direct antagonism to the mobile quickness and
agility suggested by the majority of suits dating fr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>om the
latter half of the previous century. These characteristics
may be readily seen in the brass to Sir Humphrey Stanley
in Westminster Abbey, <a href="#fig352">Fig. 352</a>; and also that to a
knight, <i>c.</i> 1510, shown in <a href="#fig353">Fig. 353</a>.</p>

<p>That this excessive plainness was not always carried
out, however, may be gleaned from a few effigies which
display an almost lavish ornamentation. The genouillière
of Sir Roger le Strange, 1506, Hunstanton, is given here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
(<a href="#fig354">Fig. 354</a>) as an example, where the spike and fluted
reinforcements are a special feature, and also the right
genouillière of Sir John Cheney, 1509, in Salisbury
Cathedral, where the cusped reinforcements are noteworthy
(<a href="#fig355">Fig. 355</a>).</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>Towards the end of the period, however, we find that
although the salient points of this Transition Period in
armour were retained, the
taste for ornamentation led
many knights to discard
the extreme plainness of the
mode, and to adapt a style
of decoration which in many
cases approached the graceful.
Effigies of the years
1515 to 1520 show flutings
upon the breastplate, taces,
and tuilles; rosettes or other
ornaments upon the splays
of the genouillières and coudières, with fluted pauldrons
of artistic shape spreading over the backplate and breastplate.</p>

<p>A suit of armour is preserved in the Rotunda Museum
at Woolwich which is of unique interest, inasmuch as it is
attributed to, and certainly is of the date of the redoubtable
Chevalier Bayard. It was brought from the Château
of St Germain, and is an object of profound regard to Gallic
visitors. The armour is engraved, russeted, and partly gilt
(<a href="#plate8">Plate VIII.</a>, p. <a href="#Page_64">64</a>), and dates from <i>c.</i> 1520 or earlier.
In places it is fluted, but a marked peculiarity of the
suit is the polygonal section of the cuissarts and jamb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>arts,
which may be discerned by a close inspection of the
figure. The breastplate is globose and the left epaulière
is furnished with a pike-guard, while the sabbatons are
of the bear’s-paw pattern.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 357.&mdash;Globular tilting
heaume. (Tower of London.)</p>
</div>

<p>For tilting purposes the great heaume was still in
use, and several examples preserved in our museums date
from this period. Not the least interesting is the well-known
Wallace heaume, of English construction, and
dating from <i>c.</i> 1515 (<a href="#fig356">Fig. 356</a>). This
rare example is formed of two plates
only, the top and back part being one
piece, and the front part or bavière
being the other. The two plates are
securely riveted together at the sides
and a piece is flanged over upon the
crown, where four rivets hold it in
place. The height of the heaume is
14 inches. It is much pitted, and in places broken.
Of the heaumes preserved in the Tower a great probability
exists that they were made for pageant purposes
or simply for funeral achievements. One of early fifteenth
century date weighs 15 lbs.; another of the usual shape,
but furnished with a comb, is said to have belonged to
John of Gaunt. Probably the most interesting in that
collection is a globular tilting heaume fitted with a bavière
which is affixed by screws, and also gripped by the visor
pivots; it extends downwards to the breastplate, to which
it was fixed by an almayne screw (<a href="#fig357">Fig. 357</a>). In it a
square opening occurs opposite the right cheek, protected
by a small door, opening and closing upon a spring.
The visor is strongly reinforced, and works upon a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>central
comb on the crown: the occularium is formed by the
lower part of the visor and the
upper edge of the bavière, and
is remarkably narrow. It weighs
13 lbs. In the Rotunda at Woolwich
is preserved the well-known
Brocas heaume (<a href="#plate39">Plate XXXIX.</a>,
p. <a href="#Page_364">364</a>), dating from the time of
Henry VII. and formerly in the
Brocas Collection. It weighs 22½
lbs. In Haseley Church, Oxon;
Petworth Church, Sussex; Ashford
Church, Kent; and in Westminster
Abbey, are other heaumes of considerable
interest, and a few are
in private collections. A heaume
which dated from <i>c.</i> 1510 was at
one time in Rayne Church, Essex,
and belonged to Sir Giles Capel, the head portion of which
was almost globose, while a second example, in which,
however, the visor is slightly ridged, or of the bellows
variety, is in Wimborne Minster. These heaumes invariably
weigh more than 20 lbs.; but the Westminster
example is an exception, as it only scales 17 lbs.</p>

<h3>MAXIMILIAN ARMOUR, 1525-1600</h3>


<p>This style of armour, which prevailed for so long a period,
and of which examples in some form or other exist in almost
every museum of importance, saw its origin in the reign of
the Emperor Maximilian, from whom it is named. It is
essentially the late Gothic style of armour richly decorated
with fluting, and reinforced by numerous extra pieces
designed to afford additional security to the wearer in the
tilt-yard. For the battle-field the plain, unornamental
armour of the Transition Period was invariably used; the
Maximilian was for tilting and pageant purposes chiefly, and
for display. Its introduction, and subsequent development
upon the lines followed by the civil dress, was a sign of
the decadence of armour for use in the battle-field&mdash;the
turning-point which eventually led to its abolition.</p>

<p>The invention and use of gunpowder was the death-knell
of chivalry in the full sense of its meaning. The mail-clad
knight and the heavily armed man-at-arms had played
their part through many centuries, and were now to disappear;
steel-clad squadrons in all the majestic might of
the pomp and circumstance of glorious war, with levelled
lance and mantling streaming in the wind, had lived their
day and were now to be no more, Armour had served its
purpose so long as sword and lance, javelin and bolt, were
the usual weapons of war; but when it was discovered that
against the deadly lead of the arquebus it was of no avai<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>l, it
was gradually discarded as obsolete and cumbersome.</p>

<p>All the examples of Maximilian armour present the
same broad features, and can be easily recognised. As an
effective defence against lance and sword and mace they
were extremely efficacious, and the armourers of the period
attained a high degree of excellence in producing suits
which were, for tourney purposes, invulnerable. The
general features of the armour followed the lines shown in
<a href="#fig358">Fig. 358</a>, which is taken from a drawing by Hans Burgkmair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
in 1508, and represents the Emperor Maximilian I.</p>

</div>

<p>A suit (<a href="#fig359">Fig. 359</a>) eminently typical of Maximilian armour,
having its whole surface ridged throughout in closely
grouped channels, is in the
Wallace Collection; it was
manufactured at Nuremberg
in 1535. The closed helmet
(<a href="#fig360">Fig. 360</a>) is of a very fine pattern, simple but effective,
with visor and bavière in one piece, only a narrow
occularium being pierced for sight. The neck artic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>ulates
with the upper plate of the gorget, which consists of four
plates (<a href="#fig361">Fig. 361</a>).</p>

<p>The breastplate (<a href="#fig362">Fig. 362</a>) is ridged with a strongly
marked tapul upon the large placcate which strengthens
it; the double-headed eagle appears
upon the upper portion of
this. In the upper centre of
the breastplate proper is a hole
of square section for affixing a mentonnière or bufe.
To the backplate (<a href="#fig363">Fig. 363</a>), in the lower part of which
occurs a fleur-de-lys, a garde-de-rein of two plates is
attached.</p>

</div>

<p>The taces of three plates have the tassets fastened to
the lower lame. The pauldrons (<a href="#fig364">Fig. 364</a>) are large and
of a different pattern for each shoulder, the right being
hollowed for the lance, with a roundel to protect the
opening. The inside bend of the arm has fourteen
splints for protection, as may be seen from the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>illustration
(<a href="#fig365">Fig. 365</a>). Strange to say, the inner bends of the knees
have the same protection (<a href="#fig366">Fig. 366</a>).</p>

<p>The sabbatons present a very fine example
of the “bear’s paw” pattern; they
are attached to the jambarts, which, as
usual in this style, are not fluted (<a href="#fig367">Fig.
367</a>). In many of the European collections,
suits of armour of this pattern may
be found.</p>

<p><i>The Helmet.</i>&mdash;The closed helmet continued
to be used during this period,
though modified and altered in many particulars
by the armourers. The flutings are carried as a rule
from front to back over the crown, and the universal comb
is decorated with a roped pattern. The
visor is generally moulded into three
or four ridges, giving the well-known
bellows appearance. The gorget is
affixed to the helmet, and appears as
three or more spreading lames of steel,
the lowest being worked into a pattern;
at times, however, it appears distinct,
and the helmet revolves upon the expanded
upper edge of the gorget.</p>

<p>A very perfect type of close helmet
is shown in <a href="#fig368">Fig. 368</a>, in which the
comb is much larger than was the
custom at an earlier date and resembles
that of a morion. The visor is formed of two parts, the
upper or visor proper, which falls down inside the second
part or bavière, and could be raised for vision if requir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>ed
without disturbing the lower portion. The date is <i>c.</i> 1560,
and it is probably Milanese. The helmet engraved in <a href="#fig369">Fig.
369</a> is of English origin and partakes of the nature of a
helmet and also a burgonet. The latter form of helmet
appeared during the Burgundian wars, hence its name, at
the beginning of the fifteenth century,
and is essentially a helmet
with cheek-pieces attached, the
protection for the face being
afforded by separate pieces, the
bufe or laminated chin-piece being
used at times. <a href="#fig370">Fig. 370</a> is an
Italian burgonet dating from 1540.</p>

<p>For war purposes the salade
was still preferred, though the
form in the Maximilian Period
was at variance with that in the Tabard, and even in the
Transition, Period. A fine example, dating from 1520, is
preserved in the Wallace Collection (<a href="#fig371">Fig. 371</a>). It has a
low comb, and the neck-guard is broken up into three
lobster-tail plates. The visor is large, and contain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>s the
occularium; in the lower part it is hollowed so as to fit the
chin, while a series of breathing-holes are pierced through
the centre.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 372.&mdash;Breastplate with
tapul. (Tower of London.)</p>
</div>

<p><i>The Breastplate</i> is short and furnished with goussets
sliding upon almayne rivets; a cable
pattern appears upon the turned-over
edges, and flutings radiate from the
waist upwards. A placcate is often
found reinforcing the breastplate after
the manner of the fifteenth century
Gothic suits, and this feature may be
seen exemplified in <a href="#fig224">Fig. 224</a> in the
Wallace Collection. If a placcate is not used, at times a
thick band of steel makes a reinforcement round the waist,
forming an integral part of the breastplate. The taces are
generally three or four in number,
and to the lowest are affixed the
<i>tassets</i>, which are laminated, and of
three or more plates, taking the
place of the now obsolete tuilles.
To the backplate is affixed the
garde-de-rein, or kidney guard,
which may be of chain mail, or
laminated scales; if of plates these are placed inside each
other upwards, so as to guard against the thrust of the
pike from a footman. The scales, if used, are also turned
in the same direction.</p>

<p>The breastplate of the earlier part of this period was more
globular than the Gothic example; the slight ridge down
the centre gradually developed into a strongly marked
<i>tapul</i> (<a href="#fig372">Fig. 372</a>). In the first years of Elizab<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>eth’s reign the
tapul was humped in the centre with a very marked projection,
but as the reign progressed this hump descended
until it was near the lower edge and produced the <i>peascod</i>
form (Figs. <a href="#fig373">373</a>, <a href="#fig374">374</a>), which was an imitation in metal of the
doublet then prevalent. For combats on foot the breastplate
was often made entirely of lames of plate moving
upon rivets, thus insuring great freedom of movement for
the body (<a href="#fig375">Fig. 375</a>).</p>

<p><i>The Pauldrons</i> are invariably furnished with large pike-guards;
the left differs from the right, which is hollowed to
receive the lance, with a roundel falling over it for protection.
The arm defences are laminated where possible, and large
butterfly coudières occur. In some suits the inside bend of
the arms, and also the backs of the knees, are protected by a
series of laminated plates affording great protection while
allowing complete freedom of movement; the beautiful
workmanship and accurate adjustment of these lames are
especially noteworthy. An example from the Wallace
Collection is given in <a href="#fig376">Fig. 376</a>; there are two examples in
that museum and another in the Tower, upon a suit made
for Henry VIII. for fighting on foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span><i>The Cuisses, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;These are long, and furnished with
one or more laminated plates at the tops for flexibility.
They are generally complete, covering the
back of the leg as well as the front; to
insure mobility the back at times is composed
of lames. The genouillières are small
and tight-fitting, but provided with large
plates to protect the back of the knee.
The jambarts are close-fitting and of fine
form, and these are the only parts undecorated
with fluting which appears more
or less over the whole suit. Sabbatons are
of the bear’s paw pattern, the toes being at times of
remarkably wide dimensions.</p>

<p>The brayette was generally composed of steel plates,
although examples exist which are made
of a single plate. It was designed to
afford protection to the abdomen, as the
breastplate only descended as far as the
waist, where the brayette was affixed by
means of straps. At times it was made
entirely of chain mail modelled to the
form, while many suits exhibit the cuisses,
tassets, and brayette made in one piece.
In deference to British susceptibilities these
pieces are removed from contemporary suits
of armour in our museums and exhibited
separately, but on the Continent they are invariably shown
in position.</p>

<p>The tilting reinforcements were many and varied, but a
few of the most prominent may be described.</p>

<p><i>The Grande Garde.</i>&mdash;This was a protec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>tion for the
left side of the breastplate and the left shoulder; it extended
from the neck to the waist, and generally covered
a small portion of the right of the
breastplate as well. In <a href="#fig377">Fig. 377</a>
the general shape is indicated, the
left or bridle arm being incapable
of a forward movement when it
was affixed. The three large screws
and nuts are for securing it to the
breastplate, and also for engaging
with the lower edge of the volante
piece, which in this example is
separate, and has oblong indentations
for that purpose as seen at A.</p>

effected. If no grande garde is used a volante piece
similar to a large mentonnière in construction was affixed
to the breastplate, generally by three
screws, and while effectually protecting
both sides of the helmet was also prolonged
over both shoulders.</p>

<p><i>The Manteau d’Armes.</i>&mdash;This piece consists
of a large concave shield intended to
protect the left side
of the breastplate and
the left shoulder, and was used in
the Italian or Free Course. It was
firmly fixed to the breastplate by
screws. The surface of the shield
was usually embossed with a raised
trellis-work design, either appliqué
or raised from the surface by repoussé; this arrangement
was intended to furnish a “grip” for the adversary’s lance
(<a href="#fig381">Fig. 381</a>).</p>

<p>The Maximilian armour
for fighting on
foot in the lists was of
very elaborate workmanship,
but not as a
rule embellished with
the ornamentation
which distinguished the
equestrian suit. A
complete suit for this
purpose is preserved in
the Tower; it was
made for King Henry
VIII., and is one of
the finest in existence,
containing as it does
over two hundred sepa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a><br /><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>rate pieces, most of them provided
with a hollow groove which fits over a corresponding ridge
upon the adjacent piece, thus presenting such a perfect
interlocking system that the suit could not be taken to
pieces without the
greatest trouble.
There are no goussets
or exposed parts
of the person of the
wearer, the whole
body being enclosed
in a case of
steel whose joints
do not permit of the
passage of a pin. It
weighs nearly one
hundred pounds,
and has the broad-toed
sabbatons of
the period, and not
only is the armour
carried inside the
legs and arms at
the bends but plates
are also provided under the seat. The breastplate has a
slight ridging down the centre, the precursor of the tapul
or prominent projection so characteristic of the breastplates
immediately following. Upon this suit arm and
knee protections are used similar to those illustrated in

shown mounted in the collection, a portion of the lamboys
back and front being removable for the purpose. A close
helmet with gorget attached protects the head and neck;
pike-guards are affixed to both pauldrons, and a tapul
appears upon the breastplate. The legs are encased in
close-fitting plate defences with no elaborate ornamentation;
indeed, but for a beautifully-designed border in brass
with the initials H and K appearing upon it, it is now
practically devoid of ornamentation. This, however, was
compensated for when new by being silvered.</p>

<p>A most interesting three-quarter suit of ar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>mour of
this period, dating from 1520, was formerly in the
Meyrick Collection but is now in the Wallace. It
was made in imitation of the slashed and puffed dress
of the early part of the sixteenth century, and these
features are reproduced by repoussé from the back of
the plates in steel (<a href="#fig385">Fig. 385</a>). Other suits of a similar
character are in existence (a portion of one being in the
Tower), but no other so fully exemplifies this peculiarity
as the Wallace example. The helmet is of the closed
type with a bellows-pattern front of five ridges, the visor
and bavière being in one piece; the chin-piece is singular
in being of only one plate hinged upon the left side of
the helmet. The gorget is a standard collar of mail. The
breastplate is globose and furnished with laminated plate
goussets (<a href="#fig391">Fig. 391</a>); five plates form the taces, while tassets
(Figs. <a href="#fig387">387</a>, <a href="#fig388">388</a>) of five plates are moulded round the thighs;
the protection behind is afforded by a <i>culette</i> (<a href="#fig390">Fig. 390</a>),
an arrangement of five plates, shaped to the figure, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
depending from the backplate (<a href="#fig389">Fig. 389</a>), thus taking the
place of the garde-de-rein. Upon these suits (<i>i.e.</i> for fighting
on foot) were at times worn the grotesque helmets which
many museums exhibit, showing satanic faces, and extravagant
erections upon the head. One of these is the well-known
ram’s-horn visor in the Tower, a present from the
Emperor Maximilian to Henry VIII. It was formerly gilt,
but has subsequently been painted
and furnished with a pair of
spectacles. Allied to these grotesque
helmets were the pageant
varieties, of which a number
are extant at the present day.
They were made solely for processions,
triumphs, general obsequies,
&amp;c., of gilded leather, wood,
and other materials. Examples
are given in Figs. <a href="#fig392">392</a>, <a href="#fig393">393</a>,
and <a href="#fig394">394</a>.</p>

<p>The latter half of the Maximilian
Period, or broadly speaking
from about 1545 to 1600, saw a
change in armour which renders it distinct from the preceding
half. The rich flutings were discarded by reason
of their tendency to hold the opponent’s lance and to direct
its head towards vulnerable spots. As a substitute for the
ornamental fluting the plain surface of the steel became
covered with rich artistic designs, some of them being of
exquisite beauty and marvellous workmanship, while occasionally
repoussé work was added to heighten the effect.
Aqua fortis was freely used for etching in comb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>ination with
hand engraving, while damascening in gold and silver was
also resorted to, the resulting suit presenting the absolute
perfection of ornamentation of that particular character.
But it is only in the surface decoration that we can admire
the armour of the period, for in other respects it falls far
short of that which preceded it. The outline was in most
cases grotesque, or bordering upon it; the metal was thinner
and lighter than before, while the devices for permitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
it to cover the bombasted breeches, so fashionable
at the period, effectually mars its beauty of outline.
So similar in contour and general configuration of the
several parts is the armour of this time (which may be
termed the Decorative Period) that a description of one suit
is to all intents and purposes a description of the whole,
and the suits severally preserved at the Armourers’ Hall
and the Wallace Collection
will answer the
purpose. These were
made by the celebrated
English armourer,
Jacobi, whose
illustrated album of
twenty-nine suits,
made by him between
1560 and 1590, is
now in the South
Kensington Museum.
The album was sold
at the Spitzer sale
to M. Stein and was acquired by the nation; it is of
extreme value to the student of armour, and a reproduction
of the work has been issued. The suits were made
for the Duke of Norfolk, the Earls of Rutland, Bedford,
Leicester, Sussex, Worcester, Pembroke, and Cumberland,
Sir Henry Lee, Master of the Armoury, Sir Christopher
Hatton, &amp;c., and a number have been preserved and
identified by the details in the album. The suit in
the Armourers’ Hall is one of the three made for Sir
Henry Lee, while that in the Wallace Collection was <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>made
for Sir Thomas Sackville, created Baron of Buckhurst in
1567, and subsequently Earl of Dorset. This suit came from
the Château Coulommiers en Brie, and was taken thence
when the château was dismantled during the first French
Revolution (<a href="#fig395">Fig. 395</a>).</p>

<p><i>The Helmets</i> are of the closed pattern, of the burgonet
type, with an umbril or shade for the eyes, made after the
style of a visor and coming well forward, while a falling
bavière (<a href="#fig398">Fig. 398</a>) is hinged at the sides and projects well to
the front, forming an occularium with the umbril (<a href="#fig396">Fig. 396</a>).
A deep comb passes over the top of the helmet. The
Sackville suit has a triple-barred face-guard as w<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>ell (<a href="#fig397">Fig. 397</a>).
A morion could be worn with these suits;
it was an oval helmet with a high crest
like a comb, and a brim which was peaked
both before and behind (<a href="#fig415">Fig. 415</a>).</p>

<p><i>The Gorget</i> consisted of four lames
of plate.</p>

<p><i>Breastplates.</i>&mdash;These are all of the
peascod form with roped turnover
borders and the goussets laminated with one plate. The
backplates are secured to the
breastplates by steel straps over
the shoulders and under the
arms (Figs. <a href="#fig397">397</a> and <a href="#fig398">398</a>).</p>

only, to which are permanently affixed the <i>Tassets</i> of four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
plates, and these may be detached from the lower edge
of the breastplate if required, so as to permit of the
bombasted breeches being worn with no covering, the
breastplate being finished at the lower edge to allow
of it. In other suits, however, the lobster-tail tassets
descend to the knees in a dozen or more lames of plate,
where they are covered by the genouillières.</p>

forward in order to protect the goussets (<a href="#fig400">Fig. 400</a>).</p>

<p><i>Brassarts</i> cover the upper arms and are provided with
<i>Turners</i>, a device for allowing the arm protections to
revolve. The brassarts were made generally in two plates,
one having a hollow roped border which fitted over a
solid rim provided for it upon the adjoining plate, thus
allowing a complete revolution of half the brassart. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>

invention of the latter part of the sixteenth

the “Forbidden Gauntlet.” Its object
was to prevent a weapon being wrenched
or forced out of the hand; the extra
plate over the fingers is considerably
prolonged, and can be securely locked by a hole in the
plate engaging with a knob upon the wrist. An example
in the Tower is illustrated in <a href="#fig401">Fig. 401</a>. With these
Jacobi suits were delivered various extra
defences, such as a manifer, polder mitten,
grande garde and volante piece, extra
pauldron for the right shoulder, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The passion which prevailed for parade
armour during the reign of Queen Elizabeth,
led, as we have seen, to a high degree
of ornamentation being bestowed upon
many suits, but perhaps the greatest
amount of intricate workmanship was
lavished upon the <i>rondaches</i>, or shields, which were made
to accompany the armour. In the Wallace Collection
there is one of the most beautiful examples in existence,
a rondache magnificently embossed and damascened, made
for Diane de Poitiers and bearing her monogram and
insignia. It dates from <i>c.</i> 1530, and is of Milanese manufacture, probably by the Negrolis. About a century and a
half ago it was purchased in Italy for five hundred pounds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
There are excellent examples in the Tower, Windsor Castle,
and the British Museum, while those at Madrid are renowned
for the wealth of ornamentation
bestowed upon
them. <a href="#plate1">Plate I.*</a>, p. <a href="#Page_16">16</a>, is of
Italian make and composed
of different pieces screwed
together; the four ovals
contain representations of
classical scenes, and four
heads among other decorations
are upon the border.
A shield which once belonged
to Philip II. is
shown in <a href="#plate2">Plate II.*</a>, p. <a href="#Page_24">24</a>;
while in <a href="#plate3">Plate III.*</a>, p. <a href="#Page_32">32</a>,
a German masterpiece by
Desiderius Colman, finished
in 1552, is shown. This was
executed at the time when
the fiercest rivalry existed
between the Colmans of
Augsburg and the Negrolis
of Milan. The subjects depicted are War, Peace, Wisdom,
and Strength. Another rondache of Augsburg make is
given in <a href="#plate4">Plate IV.*</a>, p. <a href="#Page_40">40</a>, whilst <a href="#plate5">Plate V.*</a>, p. <a href="#Page_48">48</a>, and

<p>One of the most splendid examples of armour of the
Decorative Period in Europe, or, as has been asserted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
<i>the</i> most splendid example, is the Ferrara demi-suit once
belonging to Alfonso II., Duke of Ferrara, &amp;c. <i>b.</i> 1553,
<i>d.</i> 1597 (<a href="#fig402">Fig. 402</a>). The armour
dates from <i>c.</i> 1570, and is probably
the work of Lucio Picinino; it
occupies a prominent position in the
Wallace Collection, and asserts pre-eminence
even in that wonderful
aggregation of examples of beautiful
workmanship. The pieces consist of
a breastplate of the peascod variety
with laminated goussets, and a backplate;
a gorget of five lames and a
tace of one plate, which could be
removed if required from the breastplate;
tassets, laminated pauldrons,
brassarts, vambraces, and coudières.
The entire design
of this grand example
of the armourer’s
art is worked
out by embossing
from the back to
surfaces of different
levels, chasing and
enriching with fine
gold damascening,
plating, and overlaying. The work is of remarkably even
quality, and is at the present time in an excellent state
of preservation. Examples of some of the decorations
are given in the beginning of this work, where (to the
number of four) they are inserted as ornamental head-a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>nd

<p>The closed helmet (<a href="#fig406">Fig. 406</a>) has a skull-piece with a
comb, and the chin-piece opens down the side; the very
deep visor strengthens the front of the helmet and is pierced
for sight, while the lower edge of the helmet articulates with
the upper edge of the gorget (<a href="#fig407">Fig. 407</a>), which consists of
three plates. The breastplate (<a href="#fig408">Fig. 408</a>) is slightly peasc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>od
in form, and is furnished with a massive lance-rest. The
tace of one plate has tassets of three plates depending
(<a href="#fig410">Fig. 410</a>), while the
pauldrons (<a href="#fig411">Fig. 411</a>)
consist of seven lames
each. The suit was
evidently intended for
tilting purposes, as there
are holes for the adjustment
of various reinforcements, while the lance-rest of such
strong proportions and the deep flange upon the inner side
of the tassets only confirm the supposition.</p>

<p>During the later years of the reign of Elizabeth the
ordinary armour for fighting purposes assumed a character
which is very familiar, inasmuch as it is depicted upon scores
of brasses and modelled upon hundreds of effigies in all parts
of the kingdom. <a href="#fig403">Fig. 403</a>, from the brass of Humphrey
Brewster, 1593, at Wrentham, illustrates the style.</p>

<p>The infantry of the Maximilian and Decorative Periods
consisted of pikemen (who we glean from contemporary
documents formed the greater part of the army at that
time), arquebusiers, cannoniers, and archers.</p>

<p><i>The Pikeman</i> was furnished in the early portion of
the period with a plain pot-de-fer having a turned-down
brim, but later with a crested helmet based upon the
classic style, and later still, the cabasset helmet. Very
little armour is represented upon the pikemen in contemporary
drawings of the early part of the century, but
it is probable that a breast-and backplate with occasionally
armour for the arms and thighs, were in general use.
A tunic, slashed breeches, and long hose are as a rule
shown, but no attempt at uniformity. Henry VIII.’s
army is delineated in Aug. III. in the British Museum
upon a somewhat large scale, and the pikemen are represented
in every variety of costume prevalent at the time.
Their weapons are a pike or spear of considerable length
and a sword, while a circular buckler is apparently the
only means of defence; the lower class of officers carry
the halberd.</p>

<p>During the reigns of Edward VI. and Mary the morion
and the cabasset helmet became almost universal for the
pikemen, being in many cases richly etched in vertical
bands or covered with arabesques. When first adopted
the cabasset helmet was comparatively small (<a href="#fig413">Fig. 413</a>);
about 1560 the small projecting spike at the apex became
curved, and as the century progressed the brim grew
narrow at the sides, and projected to a considerable distance
before and behind, while the height of the headpiece increased
(<a href="#fig414">Fig. 414</a>). The morion, which is distinguished from
the cabasset helmet by having a comb (<a href="#fig415">Fig. 415</a>), developed
an exceedingly large one, at times 6 inches in height, about
the years 1570-80, while the brim took on a very strong
curve and was generally roped at the edge. By the end
of the century the comb had lessened in height, and the
brim became wider&mdash;it was still very lavishly decorated.</p>

<p>The pikemen during the reigns of Edward VI., Mary,
and Elizabeth were defended by back- and breast-plates
with tassets, gorgets, gauntlets, and steel hats or cabasset
morions (<a href="#plate26">Plate XXVI.</a>, p. <a href="#Page_318">318</a>). The breastplates were made
much thicker than formerly in order to be bullet-proof, or
at least pistol-bullet-proof, while the tassets were generally
of one plate, though marked in imitation of several. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
point of the tapul gradually descended upon the breastplate
until it assumed the peascod variety and eventually
disappeared.</p>

<p><i>The Arquebusier</i> in the early part of the sixteenth
century carried little body armour; he is usually represented
in the slashed and ribbed dress of Henry VIII.’s time,
with a bonnet bearing a feather upon his head. He was
provided with a matchlock arquebus and a rest, with
a sword at the left side, while hanging from a cord which
crossed the body from the
left shoulder were the
circular powder-flasks and
bullet-bag. The arquebusiers
opened the battle,
being in the van with the
artillery.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 416.&mdash;Sabbatons, Hatfield House.</p>
</div>

<p>About the year 1550
we find the arquebusiers
clad in the armour termed
almayne rivets, a name which was first applied to the
system of sliding rivets invented in Germany, whereby
lames and plates were given a considerable amount of
play by the longitudinal slots in which the head of
the rivet worked, but subsequently was applied loosely
to suits of armour in which these rivets were used.
Henry VIII., for example, sent to Milan for 5000 suits
of “almayne rivets,” and in 1561, when an inventory was
made of armour in the Tower of London, 3752 “almayne
rivets” are catalogued, besides 350 “almayne corselets”
(Harl. MS. 7457). The armour thus designated embraced
a back- and breast-plate with espalier pauldrons to t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>he
elbows; three taces with pendent tassets of eight plates
to the knees, fastened to the thighs by straps. A rigid
gorget of plate and the headpiece completed the defence.
This armour for the arquebusiers lasted during the century
with but little variation; towards the end the tassets were
much widened to accommodate them to the breeches then
worn, and the breastplate was made so high in the neck
that occasionally a gorget was dispensed with. Among
the firearms used by the arquebusiers the <i>carabine</i>, <i>petronel</i>,
and <i>caliver</i> may be mentioned; the petronel was so called
because its straight and square butt-end was held against
the chest when fired, and the caliver was a light piece
necessitating no rest and largely in use during the succeeding
century. An improvement was made in the
loading of the arquebus, by having a single charge in a
leather case, and aggregations of these cases were termed
bandoliers; this system was in use until the invention
of the cartridge-box. An example of the armour worn by
arquebusiers and footmen toward the close of Elizabeth’s
reign is given in <a href="#plate24">Plate XXIV.</a>, taken from Edinburgh
Castle, where the high breastplate is seen, covered, however,
in this case, with a gorget. The pauldrons are large, and
below them occur complete protection for the arms, the
turners being very prominent. A similar suit is in the
same museum which is furnished with the long breastplate
strengthened with a placcate at the bottom; it exhibits
a little more ornamentation and is better finished (<a href="#plate24">Plate
XXIV.</a>).</p>

<p><i>The Cannonier</i> had no particular uniform allotted to
him, and his only distinction was an apron. His cannon
commenced the battle, as is generally the case in mode<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>rn
times, but with this difference, that he was placed in the
forefront of the fray instead of the rear. To afford him
some kind of protection a large mantlet was part of the
equipment, and in a combat a mantlet and a gun were
placed alternately. The artillery used was the falcon and
serpentin, and we have also mention of bombards, while
in the waggons were carried the powder and stone balls,
together with bows and arrows, for archers were in use at
this period and for some decades of the succeeding century.</p>

</div>

<p><i>The Cavalry</i> consisted chiefly of demi-lancers clad in
half-armour, and many suits of this
character are preserved in museums. It
was, as a rule, of better quality and finish
than that served out to the footmen, the
defences for the arms being complete,
and lobster-tail tassets reaching to and
covering the knees. The head was protected
by the close helmet or open
casque, which is furnished as a rule with
a comb, an umbril over the eyes, hinged ear-pieces, and a
neckplate at the back where a holder was affixed for a
plume (<a href="#fig417">Fig. 417</a>). A light armour, especially adapted for
infantry and light cavalry, consisting of a breastplate and
tassets which reached either to the middle of the thigh
or to below the knee, was much in use during the sixteenth
century and known as the <i>Allecret</i>. During the
Maximilian period the officers were furnished with allecrets
as a rule, while the Swiss soldiers especially were partial
to this system, which defended only the vital parts of the
body, and did not hamper the free movement of the limbs.
For light cavalry it was of great advantage, as it gave <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>much
less trouble to the horses when the legs of the wearer
were only partially defended, as with tassets. To the lance
and sword which were always carried the pistol was added,
this being generally a wheel-lock dag with a long barrel,
the charges or cartridges being enclosed in a steel case
called a patron. Troops called Dragoons came into being,
who dispensed with the lance and used as their chief
weapon a long wheel-lock pistol termed a dragon from the
shape of its muzzle, which was modelled similarly to the
head of that mythical monster. The barrel of the dragon
was approximately of the same length as the modern
carbine. The mounted arquebusier either discharged his
piece when on horseback, resting it in a fork which projected
upwards from the front of the saddle, or else dismounted
to fire in the same manner as the footman.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="smaller">

<p>There were a number of Courses or methods of combat in tournaments
during the Middle Ages, but the three chief were the Das
Deutsche Stechen, the Sharfrennen, and the Italian Course or Über
die Pallia.</p>

<p>1. The Das Deutsche Stechen. This is generally known as the
German Course, and was in use in the early mediæval period. The
chief object of the knight was to splinter his lance, or unhorse his
opponent, and with that end in view the saddles were unprovided with
the usual high plate at the back. The lance possessed a sharp point, and
the small shield upon the left side of the rider, which simply depended
from straps and was not borne by the left arm, was the part aimed at
by the opponents. The shield in the Wallace suit (<a href="#fig418">Fig. 418</a>) is 14 inches
wide, and made of oak over an inch in thickness. This form of tilting
was run with lances having a rebated coronal head in the later mediæval
period. The suit mentioned has no leg armour except the tuilles, and the
right hand no gauntlet, according to custom. About the middle of the
fifteenth century a salade was used instead of the heaume, but a special kind
of heaume like a truncated cone was used in the sixteenth century.</p>

</div>

<div class="smaller">

<p>2. Sharfrennen. The main idea in running this course was to unhorse
the opponent, and with this end in view the armour and appurtenances
were different in many essentials to those used in other courses. The
saddle, for example, was unfurnished with any support either in front
or behind, and no armour was worn upon the lower limbs, which could
thus maintain the maximum “grip” of the horse without any encumbrance.
To protect the thighs and knees of the riders large steel pieces
called <i>cuishes</i> were attached to the saddle; these were necessary because
the horses often collided in running this course, no central barrier
being used. A pair of cuishes are preserved in the Tower which date
from <i>c.</i> 1480; the edges are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
decorated with a roped border.
The lance used was thick and
heavy and provided with a steel
point; upon impact it was customary
to drop it in order to avoid
the risk of injury to the right arm
by splinters in the event of the
lance shivering. The vamplate
used in this course was of unusual
proportions, covering the whole of
the right side of the body; an example
may be seen in the Rotunda
at Woolwich, No. XVI. 102, which
is of much larger size than the
one illustrated from the Tower
Collection (<a href="#fig312">Fig. 312</a>). The body
armour was of a ponderous nature,
nearly every piece being duplicated.
In this course, if one of
the combatants was not unhorsed
immediately upon impact, it was
customary for his attendants to
rush forward and aid him in recovering
his seat.</p>

<p>3. The Italian Course, or Über
die Pallia. This course was of
later origin than the Stechen or
Sharfrennen, and originated in
Italy, as the name implies. It
was introduced into Germany
during the first decade of the
sixteenth century, and became
immensely popular. A wooden
barrier with a height of about
five feet separated the combatants,
who rode on either side of it,
left hand inwards. The suits of
armour for the course are, strange
to say, invariably provided with
armour for the lower limbs, and
a typical example is one preser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>ved in the Wallace Collection dating from
<i>c.</i> 1580, which has a closed helmet, breastplate of the peascod form with
a lance-rest, tassets of two wide plates, and a backplate (<a href="#fig419">Fig. 419</a>). The
pauldrons are of the espalier pattern with brassarts, vambraces, coudières,
and fingered gauntlets. The cuisses are wide, a peculiarity noticeable in
the armour of the latter end of the sixteenth century. Reinforced
genouillières, jambarts, and sabbatons complete the suit. Additional
defences are the large <i>manteau d’armes</i>
with the lower edge turned outwards
from the body and decorated with a
trellis pattern to engage the lance of
the opponent, and also a tilting reinforcement
for the elbow on the
left-hand side. A second suit of
much interest is provided with a tilting
helmet of great weight, the back of
which is affixed in a peculiar manner
to the backplate (<a href="#fig420">Fig. 420</a> was similarly
fastened), which rises high in order to
receive it, while the bavière is of the
form of a mentonnière, being affixed
by bolts to the breastplate. There is
a manifere for the left hand as well as
manteau d’armes and elbow reinforcement
(<a href="#fig421">Fig. 421</a>). A third suit for this
course has no sabbatons, the stirrups
being made to protect the feet.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>The lance used was tipped with a
coronal head; it was held upon the
left side of the horse’s head, and the
main idea at first was to unhorse an
adversary, which was a matter of great
difficulty, as the riders sat in a deep well-saddle with high projections both
back and front. Subsequently, however, the shivering of lances became
the chief object, and they were made light and hollow (the bourdonass)
for that purpose, and riders very seldom lost their seats in consequence.
The armour also began to lose that ponderous character it formerly
possessed, and light Italian suits were in favour. These also were adapted
for running the various courses prevailing, screw holes and adjustments
allowing of the reinforcements being attached for each.</p>

<p>Arising out of the three chief courses were various subsidiary ones,
the Free Course being probably the chief. It was the Italian Course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
used without the central barrier, and therein resembling the Stechen.
A cap-à-pie suit in the Wallace Collection
dating from about 1580 resembles that for
the Italian Course, but has an addition to the
manteau d’armes protecting the left side of
the breastplate and the top of the left espalier,
a small extra plate to fasten on this and the
left-hand part of the breastplate, together with
a reinforcing plate to fix to the right espalier.
This course dates from the second half of the
sixteenth century. The Foot Tournament was
fought with lance and sword, and no leg armour
was used&mdash;striking below the belt being forbidden.
There was also a Club Tournament,
in which a short wooden mace, the baston, was
used by the combatants, and this caused a
peculiar type of helmet to be evolved termed
the “grid-iron,” which is shown in <a href="#fig422">Fig. 422</a>,
dating from the fifteenth century. A later variety (<a href="#fig423">Fig. 423</a>) is furnished
with a latticed visor.</p>

<p>Although to the average student the armour prevailing
after the sixteenth century possesses absolutely no interest
whatever, yet as a certain amount
continued to be worn, and it possessed
characteristics entirely its own,
it is necessary to be acquainted with
these features in order to possess a
comprehensive knowledge of the entire
subject. Of cap-à-pie suits it may
be broadly stated that none exist; of
three-quarter and half-suits there are
many to be found, but extremely
few of these are of workmanship
which can in any way compare in
wealth of decoration with that of the
latter half of the sixteenth century, or vie in elegance of
form with the Maximilian or Gothic armour. The period
exhibits a brutal strength and crudity in armour which
forcibly suggests boiler-plate work. The defences are
simply made to cover the vital parts of the body with the
maximum amount of efficiency, without any consideration
whatever for gracefulness of outline or beauty of surface.
The helmet continued to be of the same pattern as that of
the end of the Maximilian Period; variations, however, may
be found; that, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
example, delineated
in <a href="#fig424">Fig. 424</a>, and dating
from <i>c.</i> 1605, is
more of the nature
of a close-helmet than
a burgonet, being entirely
self-contained.</p>

<p>A typical three-quarter
suit of English
manufacture is
that shown in <a href="#fig425">Fig.
425</a>, dating from
about 1630 and forming
a part of the
Wallace Collection.
It is shown in the
Museum as a cap-à-pie
suit, but the sabbatons
and jambarts
do not belong to it
and date from <i>c.</i> 1580.
The close helmet is
fitted with an umbril
to which is riveted the
face-guard, pierced
with sight and breathing
apertures; a gorget
plate is affixed
bearing the number
10 upon it. Under
this plate is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span> gorget proper, consisting of three plates.
The breastplate has a slight tapul and is marked 42.
Upon the right-hand side an indentation has been caused
by a musket ball. There is a backplate, and also a garde-de-rein
of three plates. The espalier pauldrons have brassarts
attached fitted with turners. The tassets of thirteen
plates have the genouillières depending from them.</p>

<p><i>Cavalry.</i>&mdash;During the early years of the reign of James
I. the cavalryman had his name altered from lancer or
demi-lancer to cavalier, probably owing to Spanish intercourse.
The general tendency to discard armour as being
cumbrous and ineffective led to many noblemen and officers
of regiments contenting themselves with a cuirass worn
over a buff coat, and subsequently, in Charles I.’s reign,
whole regiments were thus accoutred, and received the name
of cuirassiers in consequence. The dragoons also, who were
introduced into the army during the latter years of the
preceding century, only wore as a defence a buff coat made
long and full and a burgonet. Apart from these, however,
we find that the regiments using the lance were equipped
with a close helmet, gorget, back- and breast-plate,
pauldrons, vambraces, gauntlets, tassets, and garde-de-rein,
while a good buff coat with long skirts was worn beneath
the armour. The weapons comprised a sword which was
stiff, cutting, and sharp-pointed; a lance of the usual pattern
or pike-shaped, 18 feet long and provided with a leather
thong to fasten round the right arm, and one or two pistols,
with the necessary flask, cartouch box, and appurtenances.</p>

<p>The cuirassier was armed with two pistols carried at
the saddle, and a sword similar to the lancers.</p>

<p>The arquebusier wore a good buff coat, a back- and
breast-plate, and armour generally resembling the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>lancer;
he carried an arquebus 30 inches in length, two pistols,
and the usual necessaries.</p>

<p>The carbineer had similar defences, but carried a carbine
or petronel (Plate XLI.*, p. 368), instead of the arquebus,
and a sword in place of the pistols.</p>

<p>The dragoons carried a pike and also a musket.</p>

<p>In 1645 the arquebusiers wore triple-barred helmets,
cuirasses with garde-de-rein, pauldrons, and vambraces; at
the same time the dragoons
changed their muskets for
the shorter piece termed the
dragon, and four years afterwards
again changed it for
the caliver. The triple-barred
helmet of the arquebusiers
and dragoons is shown
in <a href="#plate26">Plate XXVI.</a>, from Edinburgh
Castle, and <a href="#plate25">Plate XXV.</a>, from the same source, illustrates
a three-quarter suit of an officer of arquebusiers or
lancers of the time of Charles I. A second suit, No. 32, is

helmet called a casquetel (<a href="#plate25">Plate XXV.</a>).</p>

in a morion-shaped helmet with a comb of moderate size
and a flat brim, not curved, but pointed back and front.
It was provided with a holder at the back, in which four
or five large feathers were inserted. A back- and breast-plate
reached to the waist, to which were affixed two broad

gorget or defences for the arms are shown. His arms are
a pike and a sword. Grose in his “Military Antiquities”
illustrates thirty-two different positions in the exercise of
the pike. The pikeman of
the Cromwellian period had
a similar accoutrement, but
his morion may better be
termed an iron hat, inasmuch
as the crown is low
with a small comb, the brim
wide and drooping and coming
well over the eyes and
the back of the neck, and
it is without plumes (<a href="#fig427">Fig.
427</a>). Two cheek-guards are added. A back- and breast-plate
with pendent tassets consisting of many plates formed
with a leather coat and the helmet the sole protection.
In Charles I.’s reign a rondache was served out to pikemen,
but after a few years was discarded.</p>

<p><i>The Musketeer</i> wore a morion in James I.’s reign similar
to the pikeman but with no feathers, and this with a back-
and breast-plate completed his metal defences. In 1625,
the morion was discarded in favour of a jaunty felt hat
with feathers, but subsequently the morion was again
worn with the addition of cheek-pieces. No tassets are
shown upon a musketeer’s uniform. Grose illustrates
forty-five separate orders for the discharge of one bullet
from the musket. In 1637 an elaborate drill-book was
issued by a Colonel Munro, in which he states that
musketeers should be formed in companies with a front
of thirty-two men, but six ranks deep; the first firi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>ng
at once and casting about and reloading; the second rank
passing to the front between the files to give fire next;
then the third rank, and so on until the whole ranks have
discharged. Directions for handling the matchlock published
in 1620 contain quaint directions to the musketeer:
“He must first learn to hold the piece, to accommodate
the match between the two foremost fingers and his thumb,
and to plant the great end on his breast with a gallant
soldier-like grace, and if ignorant let him acquaint himself
first with the firing of touchpowder in his pan, to bow
and bear up his body, and to attain to the level and practice
of an assured and serviceable shot, ready to charge and,
with a comely touch, discharge, making sure at the same
instant of his mark with a quick and vigilant eye.”</p>

<p>In the reign of James I. a long rapier blade was added
to the equipment of the musketeer for protection after
he had discharged his piece. It was variously called the
“swine’s feather,” “hog’s bristle,” and “Swedish feather,”
the latter probably indicating the country of its origin.
The swine’s feather and also the musket rest were abandoned
during the Civil War.</p>

<p><i>Archers.</i>&mdash;The persistence of archers in the ranks of
the English forces long after the introduction of firearms
and cannon is a noteworthy feature. During the sixteenth
century they formed a numerous force, and were the subjects
of especial care by the military commanders in the
time of Queen Elizabeth. In Harl. MS. 7457, being an
inventory of the Tower arms in 1561, there are accounts
of many hundred brigandines, jacks, salades (salletts), and
skull-caps for furnishing the defences of archers, while
regulations are extant of the same period which provide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
that: “Captains and officers should be skilful of that
noble weapon, and to see that their soldiers according to
their draught and strength have good bows, well nocked,
well stringed, every string whip in their nock and in the
middle rubbed with wax; a bracer and shooting glove
and some spare strings; every man a sheaf of arrows in
a leather case which contains twenty-four arrows, whereof
eight should be lighter than the rest to gall the enemy
with a hailshot of light arrows before they shall come
within the danger of their harquebus shot. Let every
man have a brigandine or a little coat of plate, a skull or
huskyn, a maule of lead of five foot in length, and a pike,
the same hanging by his girdle with a hook and a dagger;
being thus furnished teach them to march, shoot, and
retire, for these men can neither be spared in battle
nor in skirmish. No other weapon can compare with
the same noble weapon.” Even as late as the time of
Charles I. special commissions were issued under the
Great Seal for enforcing the use and practice of the long-bow,
and the Earl of Essex at the commencement of the
Civil War issued a precept in 1643 directing the raising
of a company of archers for special service.</p>

<p>In the time of Charles II., James II., and William
and Mary officers still wore breastplates, but armour for
the ordinary soldier was as a rule altogether discarded. As
late as the commencement of the last century the officers
of some regiments wore a small steel gorget, but all that
remains to us at the present day to remind us of the days
of chivalry and the steel-clad forces of bygone times, is the
Life Guard with his back- and breast-plate and steel helmet.</p>

<p><i>The Guisarme.</i>&mdash;This may be claimed with all confidence to
be one of the most ancient of weapons, as its first inception
occurred in the Bronze
Period, and from that
remote age down to
the seventeenth century
it was more or
less in evidence (<a href="#fig428">Fig.
428</a>). It terminated
generally in an extremely
strong and
sharp point; the two
sides were approximately
parallel, and
both brought to a
keen and almost
razor-like edge, while
a short way down the
blade a hook was
fashioned. During the Mediæval Period, when it was
known by the name of the fauchard, an agitation for its
abolition occurred in consequence of the deadly and ghastly
nature of the wounds inflicted by this weapon. There are
many forms, and additions of various hooks and spikes occur
in varieties of the guisarme; the point also was at times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
modified, and instead of being straight partook more of the
form of the curved bill-hook of modern times. The blade
lent itself to elaborate ornamentation, and many examples
of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries exhibit splendid
specimens of the work of the engraver. It was used in
England as late as the battle of Flodden (<a href="#fig429">Fig. 429</a>).</p>

</div>

<p><i>The Pole-Axe.</i>&mdash;The battle-axe and the pole-axe may
be claimed as one and the same weapon, simply differing
in the length of the shaft, which necessitated the use of
both hands in the case of the pole-axe, whereas one was
sufficient for the other. It is essentially a weapon of the
northern nations of Europe, and in its primitive form was
the flint axe of the Stone Age, subsequently fashioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
in bronze in the succeeding period. The form was as
a rule very simple from the Saxon Period to the fourteenth
century, consisting merely of an axe-blade upon one side
balanced by a spike upon the other; in that century and
also in the following it became one of the most important
weapons of war, and saw many alterations and modifications.
The blade, for example, became enormously lengthened,
broadened, and flattened, and the spike occasionally became
lance-shaped, or falcon-beaked, like a military pick, while
the head of the shaft developed into a spike or a short,
double-edged sword-blade. In the fifteenth century it
became the favourite weapon for encounters on foot, when
the pole was furnished with one or two guards for the
hands, and was strengthened with iron splints; the lateral
spike developed into the shape of a war-hammer having
a broad head furnished with rows of pyramidal studs or
spikes, the vertical blade at the head being retained. The
earliest preserved in the Wallace Collection dates from
<i>c.</i> 1350, and is similar in form to a pole-axe delineated in
Roy. MS. 16, G. VI., which shows a straight cutting
blade rectangular at the base, and with the top edge
forming an acute angle with the cutting edge. Another,
of date <i>c.</i> 1420, has a strong semi-circular axe-blade
balanced by a hammer with pyramidal projections upon
the face, the head terminating in a strong spike. Two
iron pieces almost cover the shaft for a distance of nearly
three feet. In Edinburgh an axe is preserved dating
from the Maximilian Period (<a href="#plate27">Plate XXVII.</a>) which
shows an axe-blade with a circular cutting edge balanced
by a spike, the head being furnished with a pike-blade.
The shaft is protected for some distance from the axe-h<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>ead.</p>

</div>

<p><i>The Halberd.</i>&mdash;This weapon consists essentially of an
axe-blade balanced by a pick, the head of the shaft being
prolonged in the form of a spike. In the northern part
of Europe the weapon had been in use from an exceedingly
early period, but was not introduced into France and
England until the end of the fourteenth century. The
forms are many and varied, the blade developing from a
crescent shape to that of a square, which prevailed in the
fifteenth century and preceded the curved form. The
spike also underwent changes, broadening and flattening
at times until it presented a blade-like aspect, which was
often curved downwards towards the shaft. It was essentially
a weapon for the foot soldier, and although it is occasionally
seen with a very long shaft, these are for pageant
purposes, the war weapon seldom exceeding five or six
feet in length. The form of the halberd probably lent
itself more to ornamentation than any other weapon of the
age, and those made for parade purposes exhibit at times
a remarkable wealth of decoration. The halberd became
obsolete when the pike came into favour. A beautiful
example of a halberd of the date <i>c.</i> 1470 from Edinburgh
Castle is shown in <a href="#plate27">Plate XXVII.</a>, which exhibits a singularly
long and formidable spike, with a concave cutting edge
to the axe-blade balanced by a drooping pick. The shaft
is ironed for a good distance from the head. <a href="#fig428">Fig. 428</a>
exhibits a halberd of the date 1470 where the axe-blade
is crescent-shaped and the beak slightly drooping, as in
the Edinburgh example; the spike, however, is not so long,
but has a stronger section of diamond shape. The oldest
specimen in the Wallace Collection dates from about 143<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>0,
in which the axe-blade possesses a straight cutting edge,
and the spike is superseded by a strong tapering blade. A
later example, dating from <i>c.</i> 1550, from the Edinburgh
collection is shown in <a href="#plate27">Plate XXVII.</a></p>

<p><i>The Partisan.</i>&mdash;This weapon was introduced into England
in the middle of the fourteenth century, and from
the fifteenth to the seventeenth centuries was used extensively
on the Continent, but especially in France. It consists
of a long double-edged blade, wide at the base, where
it is provided with projections of various forms, hooked,
crescent, &amp;c., and tapering to a point. It is always symmetrical,
both sides balancing in form. The Ranseur and the
Spetum are modifications of the partisan. In <a href="#plate27">Plate XXVII.</a>
a ranseur is shown from the Edinburgh Collection, dating
from the early sixteenth century: here the two points on
the lateral projections give a graceful outline to the weapon,
while at the same time increasing its efficiency. A spetum
from the Wallace Collection is shown in <a href="#fig430">Fig. 430</a>; it dates
from <i>c.</i> 1490.</p>

<p><i>The Pike.</i>&mdash;The pike was the “bayonet” of the mediæval
and later periods, and only disappeared at a comparatively
recent date. It was one of the simplest of weapons, being
merely a long, narrow, lance-like head of steel strengthened
by lengthy strips of metal, which ran for a considerable
distance down the pole, rendering it almost immune from
sword-cuts. The length of the weapon varied very considerably,
from over twenty feet to less than ten, but the
latter was the usual length. For resisting a cavalry charge
the base of the pike was fixed into the ground, an iron
shoe or point being provided to protect that part. The
long strips of steel down the shaft may be considered one
of its special features, as it could not be put out of action
by any ordinary cuts of the sword, axe, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>During the eighteenth century a half-pike was carried
by infantry officers which was known as the Spontoon. It
had a long shaft with a leaf-shaped head, the latter having
as a rule a cross-guard beneath it.</p>

<p><i>The Voulge.</i>&mdash;This weapon may be regarded as a cousin
to the guisarme, from which at times it differed but little.
In its simplest form it consists of a broad blade fixed at the
side of a shaft, and attached to it by two or more rings
which spring from the back of the blade. The latter is
invariably carried up to a sharp point over the axis of the
shaft, and some examples show a spike upon the side
opposite to the blade. The voulge is a Swiss weapon, and
was in use by that nation at a very early period; it did
not become popular among the Continental nations,
although the French seem to have used it in the fifteenth
century, when the arbalestiers were armed with it.</p>

<p><i>The Fork.</i>&mdash;The military fork undoubtedly owed its
conception to the agricultural implement, and in its earlier
forms was of equally simple construction. The two prongs
were eventually made of unequal length, and examples are
to be found having three prongs, all unequal. As usual
with shaft weapons, hooks were added with which a horseman
might be dismounted from his charger, and barbs
were occasionally added to give effect to side blows. During
the fourteenth century it was much used; it appeared
as early as the eleventh century, and was not entirely discarded
until the end of the seventeenth. <a href="#plate27">Plate XXVII.</a> from
the Edinburgh Collection is a scaling-fork with a particularly
long shaft, the very prominent hooks being designed
to drag defenders off the battlements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span><i>The Bill.</i>&mdash;The bill was in its incipient condition the
agricultural scythe mounted on a staff, and as such was
used for many years following the ninth century, but developments
took place in its structure, and it subsequently
became much altered in form, invariably, however, preserving
the one characteristic feature of a crescent-shaped
blade with the inside edge sharpened. A small portion
of the point was double-edged. This weapon was usually
referred to as the “brown” bill, which suggests that their
usual condition was a rusty one. It remained in use
until about the fifteenth century, when it was superseded
by the pike. The term “bill” is essentially a
generic one, and all shafted weapons of peculiar form
which do not fall readily under any particular heading
are classified as bills. Thus the weapon shown in <a href="#plate27">Plate
XXVII.</a>, and classified under the term “bill” in the Edinburgh
Collection, has a very strong resemblance to that
variety of the guisarme called the fauchard, but its extreme
narrowness in the centre of the blade disqualifies it. It
dates from <i>c.</i> 1470.</p>

<p><i>The Glaive</i> differed from the bill in having the cutting
edge upon the convex instead of the concave curve of the
blade, and also in being much broader. Hooks, spurs, and
other projections appear upon the base of the blade. This
weapon was more in use upon the Continent than in England,
chiefly in France and Germany, and did not become
obsolete until the beginning of the seventeenth century.
The term “glaive” may be applied to a simple shaft
weapon bearing any resemblance to a knife blade: thus
No. 7, <a href="#plate27">Plate XXVII.</a>, from the Edinburgh Castle Museum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>,
would fall under that category.</p>

<p><i>The Morning Star.</i>&mdash;This was a mace with a spiked
head, in great use upon the Continent, especially among
the German nations; both
cavalry and infantry were
armed with it, the long-shafted
weapon being
appropriated by the foot
soldier. Doubtless one of
its advantages was the
facility with which it could
be made, a skilled armourer
not being necessary. The
short weapons of the cavalry
were generally made
of iron.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 236px;">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 434.&mdash;1. Holy water sprinkler. 2.
Military flail. 3. Holy water sprinkler.</p>
</div>

<p><i>The Military Flail, or
Holy Water Sprinkler.</i>&mdash;The
Military Flail is akin
to the Morning Star and
the Morgenstern. It consists
of a shaft to which
is affixed a staple having
a chain depending, and to
the end of this a ball of iron usually covered with spikes.
At times a flail of iron or wood, garnished with spikes,
is substituted for the chain and ball (<a href="#fig434">Fig. 434</a>).</p>

<p><i>The Mace.</i>&mdash;The mace has probably a more remote
antiquity than any other weapon. Commencing in the
Stone Age, it has come down through the Bronze Period
to that of Iron, and was in general use by Egyptians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
Assyrians, and throughout the East. The Normans and
Saxons both used it at Hastings, and, as a weapon, it did
not disappear until the sixteenth century. It has undergone
many changes of form, being at times of cog-wheel
shape, oval, globular, dentated, &amp;c., but the general form
was that of radiating flanges surrounding a central head.
The knob was at times of lead, and some maces are
furnished with a spike, as a prolongation of the shaft
(<a href="#fig435">Fig. 435</a>). As early as the fourteenth century, the mace
was in use as a sign of authority among the law officers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>,
and in the sixteenth century was the characteristic weapon
of the sergeant-at-arms. The royal arms were stamped
upon the shaft at the termination of the grip: this end
became in consequence the important part of the weapon;
the ornaments and guards augmented and developed, while
the end furnished with the knob shrank into insignificance.
Finally the mace was reversed; the arms now appear
upon the upper end of the shaft in all corporation and
other maces. The mace was the weapon of militant
churchmen, who sought thus to avoid the denunciation
against those “who smite with the sword”; they argued
that although the Scripture forbade the shedding of blood
there was no restriction respecting the dashing out of
brains.</p>

</div>

<p><i>The Martel-de-Fer.</i>&mdash;Under the mace variety the martel-de-fer
may be classified. It is of very ancient origin, and
has at all periods been a favourite weapon of both horse and
foot soldiers, but probably more so during the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries than at other periods. The mediæval
archer is often represented with this weapon, and apparently
preferred it to the sword. The general shape was a plain
hammer-head projection, often serrated to prevent glancing
off plate, balanced by a pick or blade upon the opposite
side; in only a few examples is the shaft prolonged into a
spike. In the Chain Mail Period it was often made with a
heavy falcon beak without the hammer-head, while some
examples dating from the Tabard Period have two sharp
beaks of pick-axe form for penetrating the joints of armour,
which are probably the same weapons mentioned by writers
of the fourteenth century and termed bisacutas.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>
<p><i>The Lance.</i>&mdash;The spear, javelin, and lance of the Bronze
and Iron Periods down to the time of the Saxons and
Normans have been treated under their different headings.
For three centuries after the Norman Conquest the spear
does not exhibit any remarkable change; it was of uniform
size and thickness from end to end, with a lozenge or leaf-shaped
head, rarely barbed, the lozenge being the commoner
form. For tournament purposes the heads were blunted,
but as jousting became more popular special points or
coronals were introduced, of which examples are shown in
most museums. These were not intended to pierce, but
only to give a grip upon plate armour.</p>

<p>During the Splinted and Camail Periods the men-at-arms
invariably dismounted and fought upon foot, and in order to
adapt the lance to these altered conditions it was cut down
to about five feet in length. Later in the Camail Period a
small circular plate was fixed upon the lance to protect the
hand, and this subsequently developed into the vamplate of
varied form and dimensions. At this time also the shaft of
the lance became much enlarged for tilting purposes, and
was made hollow, with longitudinal grooves upon the exterior;
in this form it splintered in the encounter; when
the tilting had for its object the unhorsing of combatants
the lance was made stronger and heavier. During the
reign of Elizabeth the lance ceased to hold the important
position it had hitherto maintained among weapons, and
became obsolete, but in later times it has been revived for
the use of cavalry.</p>

<p><i>The Sword.</i>&mdash;The various parts of a sword should
perhaps be mentioned before proceeding to a chronological
description of the varieties. The two essential parts are
the blade and the hilt. The prolongation of the blade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
which fits into the handle is the tang; the upper portion
near the hilt the ricasso. The essential portions of the
hilt are the quillons, which cross at right angles between
the blade and the handle to protect the hand; the grip,
which is self-explanatory, and
the pommel, the expanded piece
at the end of the grip.</p>

(Wallace Collection.)</p>
</div>

<p><i>Pre-Norman Period.</i>&mdash;The
swords of this age generally in
use throughout Europe were of
the Scandinavian type, and may
be divided into three classes:
(1) those having the character
of a broadsword, with parallel
sharp edges and an acute point,
and the tang only for a grip;
(2) a similar variety having a
cross guard; and (3) a sword
with the blade slightly curved.
The grip was usually of wood
covered with skin, but sometimes
of bone: the pommels were of varying shapes, as
round, triangular, trefoil, and quatrefoil. The cross-guards
began in a simple projection, but increased as time went
on; they, together with the pommel, were at times very
highly ornamented. The sheaths were usually of leather,
stiffened with a wood framing. As will be seen by
referring to the plates, the sword did not vary much in
form from the twelfth to the end of the fifteenth century
(<a href="#fig436">Fig. 436</a>). The blade was always two-edged, and about
forty inches in length; the quillons at times drooped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
towards the blade, but were generally straight; the grip
varied perhaps more than any other part, being at times
almost double handed, and at others&mdash;the later Tabard
Period, for instance&mdash;was so short and swollen as to appear
unserviceable. The shape of the pommel takes many
forms, varying almost with the individual taste of the
owner; occasionally the pommel and other parts were
subjected to a high degree of ornamentation, with precious
stones and inlaid work of all descriptions. During the
thirteenth century the curved sabre was used, but very
rarely; it is shown in <a href="#fig154">Fig. 154</a>, p. <a href="#Page_125">125</a>, a group from the
Painted Chamber. Other varieties were the falchion,
cultellus, anelace, and scimitar.</p>

<p><i>The Falchion</i> was chiefly used by archers and men-at-arms.
It had a blade wide at the point; the edge was
curved and convex, the back concave.</p>

<p><i>The Cultellus</i> was a short sword, and is not often mentioned
or represented. It was designed especially for the
use of foot soldiers when rushing upon knights who had
been dismounted in a cavalry charge, or for the close
encounter of infantry against infantry.</p>

<p><i>The Anelace</i> was a long dagger which was secured
to the person by a chain. It is often represented upon
effigies and brasses of civilians in the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries, and at times assumed very large proportions.
The handle is as a rule made in the fashion of
that of the cinquedea, from which it was probably derived.
The latter is a dagger or short sword which had
its origin in Italy; the blade is generally of the width of
five fingers at the hilt (whence the name); the quillons
always bend towards the blade, and the latter, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
two-edged, averages from eighteen to twenty inches in
length. The representation given here is from a beautiful
specimen in the Wallace Collection dating from 1470
(<a href="#fig437">Fig. 437</a>), the blade of which is nearly four inches wide
and nineteen inches long; the quillons are of
latten and the handle of ivory, studded with
filigree work.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 437.</p>
</div>

<p><i>The Scimitar</i> became a favourite weapon
with the infantry during the greater part of
the Tabard Period, the blade being curved
at the back with a cusp at the point, which
distinguished it from the falchion. A finger-guard
was often added by prolonging one
side of the cross-piece, whereby it ran parallel
to the grip, and then either curved outwards
or, later in the period, turned inwards to join
the pommel.</p>

<p>In the Transition and Maximilian Periods
the sword underwent many changes, chiefly
in the hilt, which presented a bewildering variety of additional
pieces, all intended for the protection of the hand
and the entanglement or breaking of the sword-blade of the
opponent. Four examples are given here from the Royal
Armoury at Madrid which exhibit these extra guards
(Plates <a href="#plate28">XXVIII.*</a> and <a href="#plate29">XXIX.*</a>). The old cross-piece did
not die out, but became bent in another form as a capital S;
rings appeared on either side of the cross-piece and at right
angles to it; back-guards were introduced, and also the
basket-hilt. The quillons, by being curved as indicated
above, developed the knuckle-guard on one side of the grip
which eventually reached the pommel, while the other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
circling towards the blade, developed counter-guards for
protecting the back of the hand. Thus the rapier-guard
was developed, the varieties and modifications of which
are almost numberless. The Wallace Collection contains
a matchless array of these beautiful weapons, the earliest
dating from 1540: some of these have lavish ornamentation
bestowed upon them. Broadly speaking, cup-hilts were a
common form where long, straight, or curved quillons were
used in conjunction with a cup-shaped finger-guard at the
base of the blade, which was as a rule highly decorated.
The swept hilt had a broad back-guard which narrowed
towards the pommel, together with curved quillons. Upon
many swords of the sixteenth century and later curved
guards may be seen extending round the ricasso; this is the
pas d’ane, while rings may also be observed for passing
the thumb through. The rapier blade was long, thin, and
tapering; it was essentially a thrusting sword, but not
exclusively so. These weapons were for parade and the
duel, a two-edged rapier of special design being used in
war. During the eighteenth century the general tendency
of the hilt was to become less complicated and to
develop the simple basket form.</p>

Collection.)</p>
</div>

<p><i>The Two-handed Sword</i> was an invention of the fourteenth
century, and formed one of the ordinary weapons
of the foot soldier. To wield it both hands were employed
in making cutting sweeps, and consequently very
open order was necessary for troops thus armed; at first
it did not find favour in England, except for use in the
lists, being chiefly carried at the saddle-bow by knights
as a reserve weapon in case of being dismounted, when
they trusted to its use against foot soldiers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
In Scotland, however, it appears to have
been in great favour, and its practice much
resorted to. An excellent example and of
an early date (<i>c.</i> 1490) is preserved in the
Banqueting Hall of Edinburgh Castle,
which is remarkable for its exceptional
length, being exactly six feet,&mdash;four feet
three inches in the blade, and the handle
twenty-one inches (<a href="#plate27">Plate XXVII.</a>). The
grip is of the usual character and the pommel
is small; the quillons droop slightly
towards the blade and terminate in two
spirals, small engaging-guards being furnished
on both sides. There is a strong
ricasso of oblong section giving great
strength to the blade, and the usual two
lateral projections of rather large proportions.
During the Maximilian Period it
was a favourite weapon in England, and
its value for the defence of a narrow pass,
and against stormers at a beleaguered town,
was fully recognised. The Scottish claymore
is really the two-handed sword, and
the application of the name to the basket-hilted
broadsword of the eighteenth century
is a mistake. The two-handed sword
with waved blade is called a flamberge
(<a href="#fig438">Fig. 438</a>); the example is from the
Wallace Collection (date about 1630);
the blade measures fifty inches and the
handle over twelve. A ring-guard is fur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>nished on either
side of the quillons; there are the two usual projections
from the ricasso, which is covered in leather. An earlier
example, <i>c.</i> 1530, has a grip of no less than twenty-two
inches; the blade is fifty inches long, and it has ring-guards
and diagonally curved quillons
(<a href="#fig428">Fig. 428</a>). The ricasso is covered with
leather, as in the former example.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 439.&mdash;Hand-and-half
sword, 1490. (Wallace Collection.)</p>
</div>

<p>The Hand-and-half, or Bastard
Sword, illustrated in <a href="#fig439">Fig. 439</a>, dates
from 1490, and may be claimed as
belonging to the two-handed variety.
It came into vogue in England during
the Camail and Jupon Period, but
was used much earlier in Germany;
the blade is forty inches long, but
in some examples it is nearly fifty.
It could be wielded with one hand,
but to give extra effect to a blow,
if desired, the left hand could be
brought into action near the pommel,
where the grip is smaller. This type of sword was
in use during the whole of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p><i>The Dagger.</i>&mdash;This weapon has been described where
necessary in preceding chapters up to and including the
Camail and Jupon Period, when the misericorde with its
triangular blade was so much in evidence. In the reign of
Richard II. the wearing of a dagger of some kind was
universal, even the ladies having a small baselard attached
to their girdles. Shortly afterwards a long poniard of
Continental origin superseded the previous weapon, which,
like the sword, had a thumb-guard attached in the form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
of a ring. The cinquedea, which may be looked upon as a
dagger, has been dealt with on p. <a href="#Page_334">334</a>. An example of the
military dagger of the fourteenth century is in the Wallace
Collection, dating from 1440, with a fifteen-inch blade, and
is of the greatest rarity, although illustrations in missals,
&amp;c., are numerous. A specimen of the “Kidney” dagger,
so called from the shape of the base of the grip, is also
preserved there, dating from 1480; it was in common use
in England until the time of Charles I.</p>

<p>The main-gauche, or left-handed dagger, was of Continental
origin, and enjoyed an immense popularity in England
during the sixteenth century. It was held in the left hand
to ward off blows and entangle the point of the adversary’s
weapon, while the long rapier was being used in the right
hand.</p>

<h3>PROJECTILE-THROWING ENGINES</h3>


<p>No evidence is extant respecting the inventor of the first
machine for missile throwing, but we know that they have
existed from the earliest ages, and have been used by all the
great nations of antiquity. Under the Greeks and Romans,
but especially the former, they attained a remarkable degree
of excellence, and many accounts of their extraordinary
efficiency have come down to us. The Romans took their
ideas from the Greeks as a basis to work upon; among their
best authorities Vitruvius may be classed. The principles
involved in these engines were not altogether lost, but
descended to the mediæval ages, and probably during that
period more elaborate, powerful, and gigantic machines
were constructed than at any previous time.</p>

<p>The complicated methods by which a fortress was captured
or a town carried during the Middle Ages are not
generally known, and the means adopted at the present
time are as a general rule credited with being the outcome
of the skill and science of the past few centuries. This,
however, will not bear the test of investigation, for we find
that almost every device has had its prototype in past ages,
and nearly every idea has been forestalled. It comes almost
with a shock to some, and produces feelings of incredulity,
to be told that huge missiles vieing in destructive effect
with the modern shell, and as a rule many times larger,
were sent with unerring aim into the heart of a besiege<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>d
town, levelling houses to the ground and dealing destruction
far and wide. The idea of a siege in mediæval times
is generally that of a tree to batter down a door, archers to
shoot down the defenders on the walls, desperate charges of
cavalry against sallies of the garrison, and forlorn hopes of
men carrying scaling-ladders with which to surmount the
walls. These are, however, only a few concomitants of
the complicated methods by which a siege was accomplished.</p>

<p>The Greeks and Romans constructed their engines
upon the principle of the bow, whereas the mediæval
engineers adopted that of the sling. The latter was by far
the more clumsy of the two, but probably just as effective.
Had the methods by which the Greeks were enabled to
construct their splendid engines been handed down, the
possibility is that mediæval machines would have been far
less cumbersome and much smaller. Probably the greatest
living authority upon projectile-throwing machines is Sir
Ralph Payne-Gallwey, Bart., who has constructed models
of ancient and mediæval machines with most successful
results. He says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span> “My engines are by no means perfect
in their mechanism, and are always liable to give way
under the strain of working. One reason of this is that
all modern engines of the kind require to be worked to
their utmost capacity, <i>i.e.</i> to the verge of their breaking-point,
to obtain from them results that at all equal those
of their prototypes. The ancient engines did their work
easily and well within their strength. Although my largest
catapult will throw a stone to a great distance it cannot
throw one of nearly the weight it should be able to do,
considering the size of its frame, skein of cord, and
mechanism. In this respect it is decidedly inferior to the
ancient engine.”<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The author of the above has, however,
been able to construct a catapult which throws a stone of
8 lbs. to a distance of between four hundred and fifty and
five hundred yards.</p>

<p><i>The Catapult.</i>&mdash;The “Tormentum” of the Romans was
a generic name for military engines, and so named from the
twisting of the hair, thongs, sinews, &amp;c., of which the propelling
mechanism was made. What were the exact
materials used, and in what proportions, is entirely unknown,
and probably the knowledge did not extend beyond
a century or so after the fall of the empire. There can
be no doubt but that the sinews of animals played an
important part in the construction of the skein. The
method of making the catapult was as follows, omitting
unnecessary details. A quadrangular wooden frame of
great strength was fitted near one end with the skein,
which was made in the form of a circle and of very considerable
thickness, the rubber tyre of a large motor-car
wheel approximating both in size and shape. This was
folded into two parallel straight lines and passed through
holes in the frame on either side, where a simple mechanism
grasped it which could revolve the ends, cogs preventing
them from turning in any direction but that
desired. Between the parallel parts of the skein the end
of the arm was placed, and by twisting the ends of the
skein the arm was made to press with considerable force
against a horizontal beam supported by uprights at the
two sides. The arm was provided with a hollow in the
upper part for holding the stone. If now the arm wer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>e
drawn back by means of levers, ropes, and pulleys, the
distortion upon the skein was increased enormously, and
if when loaded with a projectile the arm were released, it
sprang back against the beam with great velocity and
force, throwing the stone to a distance during the action.
This propulsive force was considerably augmented in some
machines by the addition of a sling to the end of the arm,
which practically lengthened the arm and consequently
hurled the projectile to a greater distance. Ancient writers
assert that the range was sometimes as much as from seven
hundred to eight hundred yards.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 440.&mdash;Principle of the balista.</p>
</div>

<p><i>The Balista.</i>&mdash;This machine was used by the Romans
for discharging the Falarica or ponderous spear, which had
an iron head of over a foot in length at one end, with a
ball of lead at the other end, and was at times used to carry
incendiary material. It was projected upon the same
principle as the stone in the catapult, namely by means
of twisted skeins, but in the case of the balista two were
in use. They were fitted vertically in a frame open to the
front: an arm was passed through each skein, and when
the skeins were twisted, the arms sought to diverge from
one another. A rope acted like the string of a bow, and
was wound back by a suitable apparatus, thus tending to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
draw the arms to a parallel position; upon its release the
falarica was propelled in exactly the same manner as an
arrow is discharged. It rested in a directing hollow trough
until the trigger was pulled. These heavy missiles travelled
at times to a distance of between three hundred and four
hundred yards and it will thus be seen that practically the
two ends of a bow are used for the propulsive force. The
balista could also be used for discharging stones if required
by a simple alteration of the bow-string, and the addition
of another trough for directing the missile.</p>

<p><i>The Trebuchet.</i>&mdash;The Trebuchet was a mediæval
weapon derived from the classical engines of previous
ages, but depending entirely upon the principle of the
sling in contradistinction to that of torsion. It was a
gigantic arm of wood, lengthened considerably by a sling;
the arm was pivoted near one end remote from the sling,
and this beam being actuated by the fall of an extremely
heavy weight caused it to describe the quarter of a
circle and discharge the missile. It superseded the catapult,
chiefly for the reason that the making of the skeins
of the latter had become a lost art, and also that a trebuchet
could be quickly constructed on the spot required with
materials generally found ready to hand, whereas the catapult
necessarily had to be transported. Consequently trebuchets
were invariably dismantled after a siege and not carried
from place to place, the ponderous nature of the machine
presenting an obstacle to such a course. There is no doubt
that the addition of the sling was an idea obtained from
the East at a very early date, as a MS. of the thirteenth
century contains a representation showing it. In Add.
MS. 10,292, British Museum, a trebuchet is shown in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
use against a castle which is being attacked by knights of
the Ailette Period clad in banded mail. This shows the
sling affixed to the arm, but no comparison of size is
possible, as the machine is shown smaller than a horse, and
the horse is nearly the size of the castle. In Roy. MS.
16, G. VI., dating from <i>c.</i> 1330, two trebuchets are
shown in action against a castle. They are much out of
drawing, as the arm bearing the counterpoise of one is
actually shown longer than the arm bearing the sling,
whereas it was probably only a small fraction of the length.
Hewitt quotes from a work written by Gilles Colonne
(<i>d.</i> 1316) for his pupil, Philip the Fair of France, in
which he says, “Of perriers (a general name for stone-projecting
machines) there are four kinds, and in all these
machines there is a beam which is raised and lowered by
means of a counterpoise, a sling being attached to the end
of the beam to discharge the stone. Sometimes the
counterpoise is not sufficient, and then they attach ropes
to it in order to move the beam. The counterpoise may
either be fixed or movable, or both at once. In the fixed
counterpoise a box is fastened to the end of the beam,
and filled with stones or sand or any heavy body. These
machines cast their missiles with most exactness, because
the weight acts in a uniform manner. Their aim is so
sure that one may, so to say, hit a needle. If the gyn
carries too far it may be drawn back or loaded with a
heavier stone; if the contrary, then it must be advanced
or a smaller stone supplied. Others of these machines
have a movable counterpoise attached to the beam, turning
upon an axis. The third kind has two weights, one fixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
to the beam and the other movable round it; by this
means it throws with more exactness. The fourth sort,
in lieu of weights attached to the beam, has a number
of ropes, and is discharged by a number of men pulling
simultaneously at the cords. This last kind does not cast
such large stones as the others, but it has the advantage
that it may be more rapidly loaded and discharged than
they. In using the perriers by night it is necessary to
attach a lighted body to the projectile; by this means
one may discover the force of the machine and regulate
the weights of the stone accordingly.” This very valuable
description of four varieties of the trebuchet at such an
early date gives us an idea of the state of perfection to
which they had then arrived, and from other sources may
be obtained particulars relating to the size and weight of
the missiles employed. They were not always of stone,
but barrels of Greek fire, pitch, naphtha, and other inflammable
substance were used; also occasionally the bodies
of dead horses and other animals, often in a state of decomposition,
barrels of offensive or putrid matter, and other
missiles of a similar nature designed to cause pestilence, were
thrown into towns or fortresses when the defence was obstinately
prolonged. In the account left to us by Guillaume
des Ormes of Carcassone in 1240, we read: “Afterwards
they set up a mangonel before our barbican, when we lost
no time in opposing to it from within an excellent Turkish
petrary, which played upon the mangonel and those about
it; so that, when they essayed to cast upon us, and saw
the beam of our petrary in motion, they fled, utterly abandoning
their mangonel. And in that place they made
ditches and palisades, yet as often as we discharged our
petrary we drove them from it.” At the siege of Bedford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
Castle in 1224, the garrison of which were followers
of Faukes de Breauté, a leader of mercenaries in the time
of King John, seven mangonels were in use in the besieging
force. Matthew Paris mentions the terrible effects
of the trebuchets in 1246 at the siege of the castle of
Cappacio, when seven well-ordered machines discharged
day and night such an uninterrupted storm of missiles
upon the ill-fated fortress that it was battered into a helpless
condition, and had perforce to surrender. He also
states that in 1253 the Gascons hurled stones and darts
of such wonderful size that many of them were carried
into England to be exhibited as curiosities. In the defence
of castles the garrison naturally set up missile-throwing
weapons, and these were as a rule built upon the
ground within the encircling walls, and threw their projectiles
high in the air over the battlements into the
enemy’s camp. Smaller ones were also built upon the
walls and towers. Where large towns were besieged
it was no unusual thing to have from one to three
hundred projectile-throwing engines in action. The mangonel,
petrary, mangonella, biblia, and many other names
used by mediæval writers, all refer to the trebuchet and
its many modifications.</p>

<p>Various machines were invented during the Middle Ages,
in which the principle of propulsion was the steel bow
mounted upon a frame partaking of the nature of the arbalest.
These bows were at times of considerable size, and
threw javelins, spears, and weapons of a similar nature.
Being mounted upon wheels, they served all the purposes
fulfilled by modern field artillery. In the same category
may be mentioned one which threw one or two stones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
at a single discharge: it consisted of a vertical spring
of steel which was pulled backwards by ropes and pulleys,
and upon being released threw one missile from a sling
attached to its extremity and another from a cup fixed to
the steel.</p>

<h3>GERMAN, ITALIAN, AND OTHER INFLUENCES UPON
EUROPEAN ARMOUR</h3>


<p>It may come somewhat in the nature of a shock to the
self-complacency of the average Englishman to learn that
in the great stores of armour in the public and private
collections of Great Britain and Ireland only an infinitesimal
portion is of English origin, and also that England was
never celebrated in any age for the output of reliable
suits. The excellent quality of English steel is, at the
present time, accepted throughout the world, while the
care and finish bestowed upon articles fabricated from it
is proverbial, and in marked contrast to that of many other
nations. This fact is so well known that the average
inhabitant of our isles unconsciously places armour in
the same category, and believes as a matter of course
that it was pre-eminent in the Middle Ages. But the
superiority of British iron is a matter of the last two or
three centuries, and only sprang into existence when armour
was becoming obsolete, whereas upon the Continent the
manufacture in some places dates back almost to remote
antiquity. This is especially the case with regard to
Germany, whence has emanated the great majority of the
armour seen in our museums. If we take the Wallace
Collection, for instance, we find that sixteen cap-à-pie suits
are contained in it, of which thirteen are German, two
Italian, and one English. Of this number the eight ear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>liest,
dating from 1460 to 1560, are of German manufacture. Of
the three three-quarter suits dating from 1520 to 1540 the
whole are German, while of the nine half-suits only one
is Italian, the remainder coming from Germany. A similar
comparison taken in other museums would probably give
a like result. If, however, a collection has no suits of
armour previous to the year 1605, a probability exists that
English armour might occupy the second if not the first
place, inasmuch as the half and three-quarter suits in use
during the Civil Wars were largely made in England. It
must not be supposed, however, that the English armourers
of the Middle Ages were incapable of manufacturing defensive
or offensive equipments, for it is almost certain that
the greater part used from the time of the War of the
Barons to the Wars of the Roses was fabricated at home,
always excepting that worn by royalty and the most
prominent nobles. English armour was, however, heavy
and cumbrous, the inferior quality of the metal necessitating
great thickness in order to secure efficiency; consequently
those who could afford it procured the foreign
article, where the superior temper gave a minimum of
weight with the same or even better protection. It may
be compared to the modern Harveyised steel plate for
battleships, of six or eight inches in thickness, which affords
greater security than the eighteen inches of iron formerly
in use. A large amount of foreign armour has found its
way into our country owing to the law of tournaments,
whereby the equipment of the vanquished became the
lawful spoil of the victor; while the prolonged wars waged
upon the Continent by English armies&mdash;invariably with
some degree of success&mdash;must have furnished both the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
knight and the common soldier with means of defence
superior to that of home manufacture.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 441.&mdash;Spanish soldiers, eleventh century.
(Add. MS. 11,695.)</p>
</div>

<p>It is curious to note how in the early part of the
Middle Ages the same general outline of military equipment
prevailed over the civilised
portion of the continent
of Europe, and
this is exemplified in
<a href="#fig441">Fig. 441</a>, taken from
Add. MS. 11,695, a
Spanish parchment of
the eleventh century.
If the warriors delineated
in it are compared
with those represented
upon the Bayeux Tapestry,
the only essential
differences to be discovered
are the excessive
lengths of the hauberk
and gambeson, and also
the circular shield. The
trilobed pommels of the
swords and the cross
guards of the lances suggest a Scandinavian origin, but
the hauberk, nasal helmet, and leg defences are almost
exact counterparts of the Norman equipment. Again, in
<a href="#fig442">Fig. 442</a>, which represents a continental warrior of the year
1100, the general appearance is similar to our own knights
of the Chain Mail Period, if we except the peculiar helmet
and the deep indentations in the skirt of the surcoat. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
coif-de-mailles, hauberk, chausses, shield, and sword are
almost precisely the same. In the year 1330
the continental equipment was the same in
its broad character as in England, which
may be seen from <a href="#fig443">Fig. 443</a>, taken from
Add. MS. 12,228 in the British Museum,
where the only differences are the trefoil
coudière and the laminated brassarts, which
were not general in our country, although
isolated instances occur of both. During
the Camail and Jupon Period the plate
armour was precisely similar all over the
Continent, the only variations being in the
shape of the jupon, which was sleeveless
in England, but was often provided with
baggy sleeves ornamented with rows of
buttons in other countries,
chiefly Spain and Italy, while tight sleeves
were worn in Germany. The frequent
intercourse between the Continent and
ourselves in the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries led to the free introduction of
foreign supplies, and English armour lost
what little insular character it formerly
possessed.</p>

<p class="right"><i>A. F. Calvert</i></p>

</div>

<p>It may be stated as a general fact that
no authentic suits anterior to the year
1400 are in existence, although many
separate pieces are preserved which were made before that
year, chiefly helmets, mail, gauntlets, and a few pieces of
plate. The same may be said of the armour prevailing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
from 1400 to 1440, though larger and more numerous
portions of it exist, but of the Gothic armour which came
into being after that date a number of complete suits are
extant. Germany was almost the sole maker of this description
of defence, and not only are the majority of suits of
this period of German make, but Germany itself has for
long been the happy hunting-ground of collectors, and was
at one time deemed almost inexhaustible. There are many
German armourers whose names have been handed down
upon the roll of fame, but the most honoured bore the
name of Colman. This family had settled in Augsburg in
the latter part of the fourteenth century, and gradually
established a reputation; the most famous and best known
being Lorenz Colman, who began work in 1467. He was
patronised by Maximilian, King of the Romans, a few years
later, and appointed Court Armourer in 1490. In conjunction
with the emperor there can be no doubt that the Maximilian
style was evolved in the first decade of the sixteenth
century. Lorenz died in 1516, and an example of his workmanship
dating from 1515 may be seen in a cap-à-pie suit
in the Wallace Collection. His successor, Koloman Colman,
surnamed Helmschmied, produced many wonderful
examples of skilled workmanship, such as are exemplified in
his suits constructed for the Emperor Charles V. (<a href="#plate33">Plate
XXXIII.*</a>), and preserved in the Royal Armoury at Madrid.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
In <a href="#plate30">Plate XXX.*</a>, the large tilting-piece, comprising grande<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
garde, volante piece, and pauldron in one defence, is remarkable,
while the pair of gauntlets belonging to the same
monarch and illustrated in <a href="#plate32">Plate XXXII.*</a>, are admittedly
the most superb examples in existence. The magnificent
flutes, together with the delicate enrichments of the gadlings,
have probably never been equalled. The style of ornamentation
agrees exactly with
that of Colman Helmschmied.</p>

<p>The equestrian suit shown
in <a href="#plate30">Plate XXX.*</a>, p. <a href="#Page_340">340</a>, is
of Augsburg or Nuremberg
make, and is also of the time
of Charles V. It is of considerable
interest in exhibiting
the various kinds of extra
defences such as the grande
garde, garde-de-bras, and manifere, the last differing from the
Wallace specimen in having separate fingers. The subject
of horse armour, or bardings, has not been treated in this
work owing to the exigencies of space; it is a matter of
considerable interest, and the horse shown in this plate
exhibits it in very nearly its highest development. The
error is very prevalent that horse defences were of comparatively
late introduction (<i>i.e.</i> of the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries); the accompanying <a href="#fig444">Fig. 444</a> from Roy. MS. 20,
c. 7, <i>temp.</i> Henry IV. or earlier, shows defence of a very high
order, inasmuch as the chanfron covers the whole of the head,
and the crinet, of lames of plate, encircles the neck completely.
In England horse-armour originated in the twelfth century.
<a href="#plate34">Plate XXXIV.*</a>, exemplifies the wealth of elaborate decoration
bestowed upon horse furniture in the sixteenth century;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>

of a dragon with which the mainfaire is in harmony.

<p>During the fourteenth century the Italian armourers
had been making steady progress towards fame, and in no
city more so than Milan, where, towards the end of the
century, armourers came to the front whose names are
famous. A Milanese salade, <i>c.</i> 1480, is represented in <a href="#plate7">Plate
VII.*</a>, p. <a href="#Page_60">60</a>, and was produced by one of the Negroli family,
who made their home in the city. The salade is cast in
one piece, except the visor, and the ornamentation is a pleasing
combination of the Italian and Oriental styles. The
delicacy, vigour, and force of its execution may readily be
perceived upon inspection of the illustration. Another
example of the work of the Negrolis is given in <a href="#plate10">Plate
X.*</a>, p. <a href="#Page_80">80</a>, which represents a three-quarter suit made for
Charles V. The Milanese were among the first to feel and
acknowledge the influence of the Renaissance in their
work, and the decorations upon the pauldrons, coudières,
&amp;c., of this suit exemplifies it.</p>

<p>Among the armourers who were entrusted with work
for King Philip II. of Spain, the successor of Charles V.,
were the Wolf family of Landshut, and an example of
their skill is shown in Plate <a href="#plate31">XXXI.*</a>, p. <a href="#Page_346">346</a>, upon the suit
known as the Burgundy Cross armour. It was made in
1551 by Sigmund Wolf, and is richly decorated with bands
of the natural colour of the steel, on which are etched
alternately the Cross of Burgundy (the St. Andrew’s Cross),
and the emblems of the Golden Fleece, all gilded. The
high pike-guard upon the <i>right</i> shoulder is a structural
feature of this suit. An example of German armour dating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
from 1549, when Philip was heir-apparent (<a href="#plate21">Plate XXI.*</a>,
p. <a href="#Page_236">236</a>), is an excellent example of the Decorative Period
of the sixteenth century; it shows a mitten gauntlet upon
the left hand, and unequal tassets. An earlier suit, made
by Desiderius Colman in 1545, is adapted for jousting on
foot, and has lamboys or bases (<a href="#plate12">Plate XII.*</a>, p. <a href="#Page_128">128</a>). The
espalier pauldrons and roundels, the peascod breastplate,
and the lames of plate over the knee in the cuisses, are
features of the suit. Wolf of Landshut in 1554 made a
suit for Philip II. (<a href="#plate15">Plate XV.*</a>, p. <a href="#Page_146">146</a>), for the Über die
Pallia, or Welsches Gestech Course, which exhibits the
manteau d’armes affixed and a small reinforcing piece
attached to the right espalier, forming a pike-guard. To
this suit a forbidden or locking gauntlet for the right hand
is attached. The tassets are of unequal length. A helmet
supplied at the same time as the above suit is a veritable
triumph of the armourers craft (<a href="#plate16">Plate XVI.*</a>, p. <a href="#Page_166">166</a>). The
details may readily be seen in the illustration, and the volante
piece, fixed to the helmet by a strap round the gorget, and
so moving with it, is of special interest. Sigismund Wolf
in 1550 made a suit for Philip which is represented in <a href="#plate13">Plate
XIII.*</a>, p. <a href="#Page_132">132</a>. “Many of the extra pieces for this suit are
now at Brussels. The ornamentation is chaste, consisting
of narrow bands, etched with graceful scrolls and volutes
on white burnished steel.”</p>

<p>The year 1554, which saw the production of some of
the above suits, probably witnessed the delivery of another
to King Sebastian of Portugal, which is preserved in the
Royal Armoury at Madrid, and is perhaps the most magnificent
in the whole collection. The details of the backplate,
pauldrons, and arm defences are shown in <a href="#plate20">Plate XX.*</a>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
p. <a href="#Page_232">232</a>. It is the work of Anton Pfeffenhauser of Augsburg,
and undoubtedly his masterpiece; as an example of
repoussé work it places him upon an equality with the best
German masters of his time. “Mythological figures are
embossed upon the bands traversing the backplate; designs
symbolical of Power, Victory, Peace, and Navigation are
represented on the pauldrons, back and front, while the
coudières display the four figures of the cardinal virtues.”
It is essentially a pageant suit, as is also the one presented
to Philip III., when prince, at the age of seven. It is a
half-suit of Italian workmanship, formed in gilded iron and
decorated with figures, masks, &amp;c., all embossed and damascened
(<a href="#plate18">Plate XVIII.*</a>, p. <a href="#Page_196">196</a>). Another, presented to the
same monarch in his childhood, is represented in <a href="#plate19">Plate XIX.*</a>,
p. <a href="#Page_212">212</a>, and is believed to be the work of Lucio Picinino of
Milan. The decoration is less profuse but quite as beautiful
as in the preceding example. A piece of Spanish armour
made at Pamplona in Navarre in 1620 is shown in <a href="#plate22">Plate
XXII.*</a>, p. <a href="#Page_240">240</a>. Mr. Calvert states: “It is of steel-plated
iron and of extraordinary thickness.… A curious feature
is the seven indentations made by the bullets of an arquebus,
and each set with silver pearls. These marks do not say
much for the quality of the metal, which is 10 millimetres
thick. The backplate, which is only 3 millimetres thick,
has been perforated by a bullet. The arms are defended
by espaliers reaching to the elbow, where they meet the
cuffs of the gauntlets.”</p>

<p><a href="#plate21">Plate XXI.*</a>, p. <a href="#Page_236">236</a>, is a suit of Milanese make, early
seventeenth century, intended for war purposes, and absolutely
devoid of ornamentation. An example of Flemish
armour of 1624 is represented in <a href="#plate23">Plate XXIII.*</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>, p. <a href="#Page_268">268</a>; it
was sent by the Infanta Isabel Clara Eugenia to Philip IV.
The ugliness of the breastplate and the huge rivet-heads upon
the pauldrons are strongly suggestive of the “boiler plate”
armour prevailing in England at the same period. <a href="#plate35">Plate
XXXV.*</a> is a suit presented by the Cardinal Infante
Ferdinand to Philip IV., and exhibits the lames of plate
inserted in the gousset of the coudière, similar to the Henry
VIII. foot armour in the Tower.
It is of Milanese make, and
decorated with vertical bands of
medallions, &amp;c.</p>

</div>

<p>A second example of armour
of Spanish make is given in
<a href="#plate36">Plate XXXVI.*</a>; it was fabricated
at Pamplona for the Duke
of Savoy in 1620, and is decidedly an improvement upon the
suit shown in <a href="#plate19">Plate XIX.*</a>, p. <a href="#Page_212">212</a>, which came from the
same locality. It is worthy of remark that Spain, with all its
vast resources of the finest iron ores in the world, did not
become a centre for arms and armour. She was undoubtedly
able to supply her own requirements, and in the wars
against the Moors these were of no mean order, but no
distinct Spanish “School” was evolved similar to the
German or Italian. The excellent quality of her swords
attained world-wide reputation, and the blades of Toledo,
Bilbao, and Seville are justly famous. No town in France
achieved special success in armour or arms, although many
were active in the production. Burgundy was chiefly noted
for its eccentricities, the breastplate illustrated in <a href="#fig445">Fig. 445</a>
furnishing an example, though many inventions, such as
the burgonet, emanated from that warlike district, whi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>le
its hand-gun men of the fifteenth century were the best
in the world. Holland and Belgium have always enjoyed a
reputation for arms, and Netherlandish weapons and defences
were in great demand. The overwhelming superiority
of Italian products must not be ascribed solely to one
town, Milan, for many others were famous, such as Pisa,
Verona, Lucca, Mantua, and Brescia, while Florence became
a serious rival to Milan in the latter part of the sixteenth
century. In Germany, Augsburg and Nuremberg probably
were the most renowned for armour, but Cologne bore
pre-eminence for weapons.</p>

<p>The invention of gunpowder and its use in propelling
missiles from tubes was the signal for the abolition of
armour, as we have indicated, though the struggle for
supremacy between the two lasted for considerably more
than a century. The Eastern nations are generally credited
with the discovery of the properties of a mixture of saltpetre,
carbon, and sulphur so far as their use in fireworks is
concerned, but it was undoubtedly to the Western nations
that the knowledge and application of the propelling nature
of the mixture were due. The first authentic account of
its use for military purposes must be ascribed to the seventh
century, when, under the name of Greek fire, it was used at
the defence of Constantinople by the Byzantine emperors
against the invading Saracens. The true Greek fire, however,
is supposed to have contained more ingredients than
the three which constitute gunpowder proper, viz. resin and
naphtha, the latter being in excess, and this mixture appears
to have been so inflammable and so difficult to extinguish
that the terror excited by its use was out of all proportion
to the destruction that it wrought. It was propelled from
balistæ, projected from tubes, and carried by means of
arrows which bore tow steeped in the composition, while its
use in a besieged town to pour down upon assailants was
probably the most efficacious. Its composition was for <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>a
long time kept secret, but the knowledge gradually spread,
and during the later mediæval period its use was not unknown
in England (<a href="#fig337">Fig. 337</a>). Gunpowder proper was used
for the first time in the Spanish wars with the Moors in
the twelfth century by both combatants; and the secret
of its composition was discovered by Roger Bacon in the
thirteenth century, probably from the translation of manuscripts.
Schwartz, a German Frank, perfected it about a
century later, and its first use in England occurred in the
wars against the Scots by Edward III. in 1327, when the
cannon were denominated “crakeys,” a diminutive from
“crake,” the first name of the composition, which may be
a corruption of “grec.” At the siege of Cambrai in 1339
cannon were in use, and they are specifically mentioned by
Froissart. After that time their use became general, and
in 1346 many were in operation at the battle of Creçy,
the gunpowder being imported from abroad until the reign
of Elizabeth, when English powder-mills were established
in the country. The word artillery had been in use to
denote projectile-throwing weapons anterior to the use of
gunpowder, and became eventually the term by which the
larger kind of firearms was designated. The construction
of the first cannon was, as might be inferred, of the rudest
possible description. Pieces or bars of iron were arranged
longitudinally so as to form a rough tube, around which
iron hoops were placed to hold them together. The powder
and ball were in a separate case, open at one end to allow
of the exit of the ball; this case was inserted in one end
of the tube and secured by a stirrup arrangement pivoting
upon two projections on either side of the tube, which
fell over the open end and prevented the case from bei<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>ng
blown out when the discharge occurred. The powder was
fired by the insertion of a red-hot wire. The cannon was
fixed down to a piece of timber which rested upon a similar
piece: at the breech end of the cannon the two planks were
hinged together, and by the insertion of wedges in the
front between the timbers the piece could be elevated.
Other contrivances almost as crude as that described were
introduced in order to overcome the difficulties of taking
aim. The projectiles were at first made of stone, and subsequently
of lead or iron, or stone coated with lead. It must
not be supposed that the introduction of such weapons
created the profound consternation which a few contemporary
writers have led us to suppose; the general impression produced
was, in fact, one of contemptuous indifference, and
it was only after many improvements had been effected that
cannon began to be taken seriously. The earliest were
only used in sieges, as the transport of such cumbrous pieces
was nearly an impossibility, and when they were subsequently
adopted for use in the field it was but seldom they
were used after the first discharge. During the fifteenth
century fresh developments took place; trunnions were
invented, whereby the recoil was transferred directly to the
carriage; the weapon was cast in one piece which tapered
towards the muzzle, and many improvements in loading and
discharging were made. Bombards were introduced, being
short pieces with a large bore which were fired at a considerable
elevation and discharged balls of stone to a small distance;
they were the prototypes of our modern mortars and
howitzers. One of the earliest examples of mediæval
ordnance preserved in this country may be seen at the
Rotunda, Woolwich (<a href="#plate40">Plate XL.</a>, p. <a href="#Page_366">366</a>). It is known as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span> the
Creçy Bombard, and may possibly date back to the time of
Edward III. It is said to have been found in the moat
of Bodiham Castle, Sussex, and is known to have been
in Battle Abbey for many years. Its interior is of cast
iron, one of the earliest known specimens of the metal in
that form, and iron hoops have been shrunk upon this
inner core. The chamber in the smaller portion of the
breech will hold about three or four pounds of powder;
the stone shot discharged weighed about a hundred and
sixty pounds and was fifteen inches in diameter. The
carriage is modern. The cannonier wears a capacious
salade and is defended by a hauberk of mail and a thick
leather apron; he is discharging the bombard with a hot
iron and protects his face with his hand from the inferior
powder blown off the touch-hole by the explosion.</p>

<p>Very large cannon were in use at times. Mons Meg at
Edinburgh is an example of a fifteenth century production;
it weighs nearly four tons, has a calibre of 20 inches, and
threw a stone projectile of 300 lbs. The powder-chamber
is considerably smaller in bore than the cannon, in order
to withstand the force of the discharge. This piece is
reputed to have been made in 1455 for the siege of
Thrieve Castle by James II.; this latter monarch was
killed five years later by the bursting of a similar
cannon, the Lion. Another example is preserved at
Ghent, where a foundry existed for their manufacture:
the piece has a calibre of 26 inches, while English guns
are to be seen at Mont St. Michael of 15 inches and 19
inches bore respectively. A remarkable example of fifteenth
century monster ordnance is the Dardanelles bronze gun
preserved at the Rotunda, Woolwich, and illustrated in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
<a href="#plate38">Plate XXXVIII</a>. It was cast during the reign of Sultan
Mahomed II., <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1468, and presented to Queen Victoria
by the Sultan of Turkey in 1867. It weighs 18 tons
14 cwt., the calibre is 25 inches, and the total length equals
17 feet. It is made in two parts, which are screwed together,
and the breech portion which forms the powder
chamber has a bore of only ten inches. The stone shot
weighed 6 cwt. each. The names applied to ancient
ordnance were many and various, and at the same time
confusing, inasmuch as the calibre of the various pieces was
constantly changing. The following is an approximate
list of some of the pieces ordinarily in use:&mdash;</p>

<p>Cannon Royal, weight of shot, 66 lbs.; Carthorun,
48 lbs.; Cannon, 34 lbs.; Bastard Cannon; Great Culverin,
15 lbs.; Bastard Culverin, 7 lbs.; Demi-Culverin, 2 lbs.;
Basilisk, Serpentin, Aspik, Dragon, Syren. For field
service: Falcon, 1 lb.; Falconet, 14 ozs.; Saker.</p>

<p>Cannon have been made of various materials apart from
iron and bronze, such as wood, paper, and rope, the outside
covering being of leather. All the early guns used
in England were obtained from abroad; the first foundry
in England was that of Hugget of Uckfield, Sussex, in
1521, who cast cannon in brass and iron, using the Sussex
iron smelted with charcoal. There are some pieces of
ordnance preserved in the Rotunda at Woolwich which
are of this age, and may possibly have come from the
Sussex foundry. Examples of early cannon are rare in
England, but on the Continent many may be found,
especially in Belgium. The Rotunda and the Tower of
London probably contain the finest specimens in the
British Isles. In the Royal Arsenal at Madrid is pr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>eserved
a small piece of ordnance dating from late fifteenth century.
It is double-barrelled and breech-loading, and exhibits a
wealth of ornamentation upon almost every part (<a href="#plate37">Plate
XXXVII.*</a>). A breech-loading peterara of forged iron of
the time of Edward IV. is in the Rotunda, and is illustrated
in <a href="#plate39">Plate XXXIX</a>. It is made of longitudinal bars
of iron hooped together with iron rings; the powder-chamber
with its lifting handle is seen in position, and
a simple locking arrangement prevented its blowing out
upon the discharge. Trunnions are affixed to the piece, and
the metal by which it was attached to the long-decayed
wooden gun-carriage is still preserved. The length of the
gun is 3 feet and the calibre 2½ inches, while the name
implies that the shot was of stone. This very rare piece
of ordnance is in excellent condition.</p>

<p>The progress in artillery was very slow, but gradually
cannon became mounted upon wheels and rude carriages,
an advance upon the logs and cumbrous beds of the preceding
period, while iron was substituted for stone in the
projectile. The engagement of trained professional gunners
in place of the civilians who had managed the artillery
in the fourteenth century, was another step which led to
improvement, Dutch artillerymen being employed by
Henry VIII. Charles VIII. and subsequent French
monarchs undoubtedly did much for the improvement of
the weapon; they adopted light guns for field artillery,
and introduced the system of rapidly taking up different
positions from which to assail the enemy. The Civil
War in England found a great scarcity of cannon, and
more particularly of efficient gunners, and generally it
may be stated that the English use of artillery was much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
behind that existing upon the Continent until the middle
of the eighteenth century.</p>

</div>

<p>The existence of cannon in the mediæval period would
naturally suggest a weapon that might be used in the
hand, and from a very early period hand-guns have been
in evidence. They are rarely mentioned by writers of
the time, and very few illuminations are extant showing
the weapons then employed, which would tend to show
that their use was restricted, and their efficacy valued
but little. The earliest were simply tubes affixed to a
stick and fired by means of a lighted match; some of
them were ignited from the muzzle, thus indicating that
they were shotless and only used to frighten horses in a
cavalry charge. The long-bow and arbalest were of
infinitely greater efficacy than the early hand-gun, and it
is a matter for wonder that the latter held a place at
all in the armies of the period. It was made in various
shapes, but that generally shown in contemporary illustrations
is depicted in <a href="#fig339">Fig. 339</a>, the piece being discharged
by means of a touch-hole on the top of the barrel near
the breech. The earliest use of a hand-gun is involved
in obscurity; there can be no doubt that many attempts
were made to introduce such a weapon, but the first
mention that occurs is in the reign of Edward III., when
they were brought into England from Flanders. They
were in use by both horse and foot soldiers, the stock in
the first case being shortened so that it could be placed
against the chest, while in the second it passed under
the right arm, the left hand being used to grasp it and
the right to hold the discharging match. The gun was
supported in the case of cavalry by a forked rest wh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>ich
projected from the saddle. In all these guns the powder-chamber
was smaller than the calibre of the barrel. In
some cases the hand-gun was used as a mace after being
discharged.</p>

<p><i>Hand Culverin.</i>&mdash;A larger hand-gun was subsequently
evolved, which was much in use during the second half
of the fifteenth century, and necessitated the presence of
two men for its manipulation. It was called the hand
culverin, and had a bore of about three-quarters of an
inch; it was constructed of forged iron, and was attached
by bands to a straight stock of wood. This weapon was
fired from a rest. It was subsequently improved by the
addition of a pan and touch-hole at the side and a modification
of the stock, while the barrels were often of brass
or bronze, and polygonal in section. Their weight varied
from ten to sixteen pounds, and a variety which was carried
on horseback at times weighed nearly sixty pounds.
Warwick the King-maker employed “Burgundenses” or
Burgundian hand-gun men in the Second Battle of St.
Albans, 1461, and culveriners formed a part of the forces
under Edward IV. in the later battles of the Wars of
the Roses.</p>

<p><i>The Serpentin, Matchlock, or Arquebus.</i>&mdash;An improvement
was made about the year 1500, whereby the slow
match, hitherto held in the hand, was affixed to a lever
bent into the form of a serpent and fastened by the
centre to the stock on a pivot; by pulling the lower
portion the upper end carrying the match was made to
descend upon the priming powder. Subsequent innovations
consisted of a sliding cover over the flash-pan, and
the jointing of the serpentin to increase the levera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>ge.
The matchlock was in use for about two centuries, in
spite of the cumbersome nature of the weapon, the slow
rate of its discharge, the trouble involved in keeping the
match alight during boisterous or rainy weather, and the
heavy rest for holding it when loading and taking aim.
The greatest merit was undoubtedly its simplicity and
cheapness. The arquebus shown in <a href="#plate27">Plate XXVII.</a>, p. <a href="#Page_322">322</a>, is
of the sixteenth century, time of James VI., and is in the
Edinburgh Museum. The figure of an arquebusier may
be discerned in <a href="#plate8">Plate VIII.</a>, p. <a href="#Page_64">64</a>, under the horse’s head of
the Bayard figure. The arquebus is seen poised upon its
rest with a piece of loose tow hanging from the barrel;
the arquebusier is in the act of taking aim, and is accoutred
in seventeenth century military dress. In <a href="#plate39">Plate XXXIX.</a>
a wall arquebus is shown from the Rotunda, which is nearly
9 feet in length and weighs 87 lbs. It is fitted with a
tube sight and an arrangement for pivoting in an iron
socket upon a wall or in an embrasure. Its calibre is
1.3 inches. These pieces were at times carried into the
field and required three men to manipulate them.</p>

<p><i>The Wheel-lock.</i>&mdash;The great difficulty experienced in
keeping the match alight resulted in the invention of the
wheel-lock in the earlier part of the sixteenth century at
Nuremberg, and its introduction into England about 1540.
The mechanism consisted of a wheel serrated at the edge
which protruded into the priming pan, and was fixed by its
axle to the lock plate (Plate XLI.). This axle was made
square upon the outside for a key, while at the other end a
strong spring engaged with it; by winding it the spring
was compressed and held in place by a catch. The lock
held a piece of pyrites, and when it was depressed re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>sted
in the priming pan, which had a removable cover; upon
the trigger being pulled the spring caused the wheel to
revolve quickly, whereby its file-like edges struck sparks
of fire from the pyrites with which it was in contact and
thus ignited the powder. For the cavalry and also for
sporting purposes the wheel-lock was in use for many
years, but its cost precluded a general introduction among
the infantry. A high degree of ornamentation was
lavished upon many of these weapons; examples may be
readily found in all museums of importance.</p>

<p><i>The Snap-hance.</i>&mdash;This variety of lock was invented
in Holland or Germany about 1550, and from the simplicity
and ease with which it was made and the consequent
cheapness of production, rapidly came into favour
in England and on the Continent. It is said to have been
evolved by a body of Dutch poultry stealers (Snaphans),
who could not use the matchlock because of the light
entailed, or the wheel-lock because of the expense, and
thereupon devised the snap-hance, little dreaming that
the invention would become so popular. The wheel-lock
was superseded by a hammer which struck upon a piece
of sulphurous pyrites; the flash-pan was the same, but
the cover was actuated by a spring and flew back when
the hammer descended, thus allowing a free passage for
the shower of sparks.</p>

<p><i>The Flint-lock.</i>&mdash;The snap-hance was undoubtedly the
intermediate weapon between the wheel-lock and flint-lock.
The latter may be claimed as an English invention,
as a specimen occurs in the Tower having the date 1614
upon it, the date generally assigned for its introduction
being 1630 according to continental records. The knowledg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>e
that fire could be produced by striking flint upon
steel was well known to the ancients. In the flint-lock
the fall of the hammer containing the flint was made to
open the flash-pan and at the same time to strike sparks
from its cover. The earlier kinds had all the mechanism
upon the outside of the lock, but subsequently it was
hidden, and a tumbler connected the mainspring with the
hammer. Highly decorated examples of the flint-lock are
common, especially those of Italian and Spanish origin
(Plate XLI.*). The weapon did not come into extensive
use in England until the second half of the seventeenth
century, but it eventually superseded all others, and was
adapted for every kind of firearm, both military and civil,
and remained in use until the advent of the percussion cap
about 1830.</p>

<p>Pistols underwent the same variations as the larger
weapon, but these were often combined, being fixed in
shields, battle-axes, pole-axes, daggers, halberds, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The subject of this chapter is an extremely wide one,
and an attempt to cover it completely in the pages of
this work has not been attempted; the broad facts given
here may, however, be acceptable to the general reader.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
